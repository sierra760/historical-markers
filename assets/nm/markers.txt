Camillo Seux (born in Lyon, France), our pastor from 1868-1922, \nerected the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes that is on the pedestal in front of the church across the street. Large numbers of pilgrims came to pray on their knees on the pavement beneath the statue. Moved by this sight, Fr. Seux decided to use his family's inheritance to build the Shrine.\n\nWorking with San Juan Pueblo's governor, he obtained a deed for the property. Possibly influencing the site for\n\n[ Panel 2: ]\nthe Shrine is the fact that it was on this approximate site on which the third parish church was built in 1645 and later destroyed in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680.\n\nThe Shrine was consecrated and blessed on April 19, 1890 by Archbishop Jean Baptiste Salpointe. We believe that the architect for the construction of the Shrine was Martin Mouley, the same architect who built the Basilica of St. Francis and the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe. The Shrine is built one-fifth scale to Sainte Chapelle in Paris which was built in 1248 and is the quintessential model of French Gothic church architecture.\n\nThe Shrine is one of only 19 buildings in the United States built entirely out of lava rock. It contains the original stained glass windows imported from Claremont, France. The golden stars and the gold on the altar in the apse are 23 carat gold. The statues of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Bernadette in the apse are part of the original Shrine.\n[ Panel 3: ]\n\nOur Shrine was renovated in 2004 and rededicated by Archbishop Michael Sheehan on December 8, 2004, the 150th anniversary of the issuance of the Dogma on \nMary's Immaculate Conception, the name she gave to St. Bernadette when asked who she was. During renovation we decided not to install electricity but instead, Elvira Salazar, who had conserved one of the original chandeliers, donated it back to the church, and with donations from Sara Montoya, her sister, and from \nthe family of Dominic Maestas, we replicated two other chandeliers. The original is nearest to the altar.\n\nFr. Seux, in the tradition of French burials of its famous priests, is buried under the floor boards of the main aisle, along with his assistant priest for \nmany years, Fr. Alverline who also died in 1922.\n\nPresently we celebrate daily Mass in the shrine from May to October.

Surveyors Darling, Robbins, Reeves and Carpenter surveyed the boundary lines between the states.\n\nIn 1899, U.S. Surveyors Hubert Page and James Lentz found the four corners monument disturbed and broken. They marked and set a new stone at the original location. Everett Kimmell, General Land Office, remonumented the Page \u2013 Lentz stone with a concrete and brass monument in 1931. The Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs poured a concrete paving block around the Kimmell monument in 1962. In 1992, Cadastral Surveyors Darryl Wilson and Jack Eaves officially remonumented the deteriorating Kimmell marker with an aluminum bronze disc.

John Robert Baylor led 300 men consisting of two companies of the Second Texas Mounted Rifles, a Texas light-artillery company without its howitzers, an El Paso County scout company, and some civilians from Fort Bliss to Fort Fillmore, New Mexico Territory.\n\nThe Texans reached the vicinity of Fort Fillmore at night and placed themselves between the fort and its water supply at the river. Baylor cancelled a planned attack after learning that one of his men had warned the garrison. His Texans forded the Rio Grande and early that afternoon entered nearby Mesilla, a strongly pro-Confederate community. With 380 infantry and mounted riflemen, plus howitzers, Union Major Isaac Lynde approached Mesilla from the south on July 25 (see map). Baylor rejected his demand for surrender. Lynde ordered his artillery to open fire. After a bungled charge, Lynde ordered a return to the fort. The Confederates remained in Mesilla, fearing a trap. Baylor sent to El Paso for artillery and additional men. When Lynde found out that Baylor had sent for artillery, he ordered Fort Fillmore abandoned that night. Because Baylor blocked the shortest retreat route, north up the Rio Grande toward Fort Craig, Lynde and his troops headed northeast toward San Augustin Pass in the Organ Mountains with the objective to reach Fort Stanton, 150 miles away.\n\nAt sunrise on July 27, Baylor discovered Lynde's withdrawal. Baylor's troops and some \"Arizona\" civilians gave chase. By the time Baylor's speediest horsemen caught up with the stragglers, the roadside was littered with discarded equipment and prostrate regulars begging for water. Lynde and his mounted troops reached San Augustin Springs, and attempted to send water back to the lagging infantry. Baylor with part of his command crossed the mountains by another pass and early in the afternoon of July 27, rode unopposed into Lynde's temporary camp. After a short discussion, Lynde surrendered his 492-man force. The victory at Mesilla was one of the war's early and surprising Confederate successes. \n\nOn August 1, Baylor proclaimed the Arizona Territory, Confederate States of America, and named himself governor. Mesilla remained the capital of the Confederate Arizona Territory until the Texan military forces withdrew back to Texas in July 1862. Baylor's dashing actions of the summer of 1861 added to his fame as a folk hero.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 137485, "filename": "137485.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "November 4, 2010", "submitted": "November 21, 2010, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Civil War Battle of Mesilla & Major Lynde's Retreat Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 137487, "filename": "137487.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "November 4, 2010", "submitted": "November 21, 2010, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Civil War Battle of Mesilla & Major Lynde's Retreat Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 137488, "filename": "137488.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "November 4, 2010", "submitted": "November 21, 2010, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Lt.

They were capable of knocking down high-flying, fast-moving bombers with high-explosive warheads or, equipped with a nuclear warhead, destroying a whole formation of attacking enemy airplanes with one missile.\n\nThe Nike Hercules is typical of weapon systems tested at White Sands Missile Range from many launch complexes stretching east from here. It was America's second generation air defense missile system and was preceded in testing at White Sands by the Nike Ajax.\n\nTesting at White Sands for the Nike Hercules bean in 1955 and concluded in 1967 with a total of more than 650 missiles fired.\n\nNot only was Nike Hercules capable of destroying enemy airplanes, it shot down a Corporal ballistic missile in 1960. Ironically, Nike Hercules missiles themselves were later used as targets for the Nike Zeus system which was specifically designed to destroy incoming Soviet missiles. \n\nMost U.S. Hercules batteries in the continental United States were deactivated by 1975. However, some of our allies fielded the system through the early 21st century.\n\nThe Nike Hercules stands 41 feet tall and is 31.9 inches in diameter. At liftoff it weighed 10,700 pounds and used solid propellant in the booster and missile to reach speeds in excess of 2,500 miles per hour.

It was a light field piece of great mobility and intended for use in all kinds of rough terrain.\n\nIn early April 1862, Civil War Confederate forces that had invaded New Mexico Territory began their retreat back to Texas following defeat at Glorieta Pass, east of Santa Fe, two weeks earlier. Confederate artillery commander Major Trevanion T. Teel buried eight cannon barrels near this Plaza to prevent their capture by pursuing Union Forces.\n\nTwenty-seven years later, Major Teel returned to Albuquerque to show local citizens where the cannon barrels were buried. On August 19, 1889, all eight barrels were excavated from a chili pepper patch, formerly a corral, some 500 feet northeast of San Felipe de Neri Church, near the present day Albuquerque Museum of Art and History. Two of the barrels have remained in Albuquerque.\n\nLocal residents made new carriages for the two remaining cannon barrels and displayed them on the Plaza for many years. Because of the great value of the original barrels, replicas were later made and replaced the originals on the Plaza. These replica barrels are mounted on \"Prairie\" style gun carriages -- most likely the configuration used by Confederate forces in New Mexico. It is sometimes said that these two mountain howitzers \"guard\" the Old Town Plaza. They represent a proud and important era in Albuquerque history.\n\nThe original mountain howitzer barrels and other artifacts from the New Mexico Campaign of the Civil War are on display at the Albuquerque Museum of Art and History, two blocks northeast of the Plaza.\n\nThe City of Albuquerque and the donors listed on the opposite side of this marker completed a howitzer restoration and interpretation project in 2007.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 607855, "filename": "607855.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

Nearly 600 settlers accompanied him, along with Mexican Indian allies and Franciscan friars. In a great cloud of dust, the slow-moving oxen-pulled carreta caravan creaked through the Valley of San Bartomlom\u00e9, sending its way northward.\n\nDriving thousands of sheep, pigs, goats, cattle, mules and horses before them, men, women, and children overcame the hardships of the next seven months on the jornada. Scouts wandered far ahead of the wagon train searching for a route with adequate water and pasturage. For months on end, the desert air resounded with sharp cracks from whips of drovers who pushed the caravan farther into the tierra adentro. In late April, as they approached the Rio Grande near a place they called El Paso, light snow fell and a cool wind swept the Chihuahuan desert.\n\nBy mid-June, the Spanish frontiersmen had reached Socorro, where, in need of food, they traded with the Pueblo of Teypana. Slowly, their carretas rolled northward, passing through the valley of present-day Albuquerque, along the route that became El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, the Royal Road of the Interior, which originated in Mexico City.\n\nOver seventy-five miles in advance of the wagon train, on July 4, 1598, O\u00f1ate and sixty horsemen reached San Juan Pueblo. Nearby, they established the first capital of New Mexico, which they named San Juan de Caballeros. By mid-August, the rest of the founding settlers of New Mexico arrived with sixty-one carretas. That summer, the first of many Hispanic settlements in New Mexico had been established.

The hotel was described by one affectionate traveler as \"one of the last of the Harvey Houses and the most beautiful of them all, with old gray stucco and the turquoise trim, its cool courts and shady patios inviting siesta, its Indian museum packed with old Pueblo artifacts, its slow heartbeat of the coming and going of the Santa Fe trains.\"", "photos": [{"photo_id": 165455, "filename": "165455.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 2, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Hotel Alvarado Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2528, "height": 1841, "aspect": 1.37316675719718}, {"photo_id": 165456, "filename": "165456.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 2, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Hotel Alvarado Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is just to the left of the entrance to the Albuquerque Alvarado Transportation Center.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 167261, "filename": "167261.jpeg", "photographer": "Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, Washington", "taken": null, "submitted": "August 11, 2011.", "caption": "Hotel Alvarado - West Side", "subcaption": "HABS NM-123", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 510, "aspect": 1.25490196078431}, {"photo_id": 167262, "filename": "167262.jpeg", "photographer": "Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington", "taken": null, "submitted": "August 11, 2011.", "caption": "Hotel Alvarado - East Front", "subcaption": "HABS NM,1-ALBU,5-4", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 509, "aspect": 1.2573673870334}, {"photo_id": 167263, "filename": "167263.jpeg", "photographer": "Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington", "taken": null, "submitted": "August 11, 2011.", "caption": "Hotel Alvarado Indian Building", "subcaption": "HABS NM,1-ALBU,5-19", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 510, "aspect": 1.25490196078431}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.64798, 35.08356]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 45447, "number": null, "title": "Albuquerque Electric Streetcar System", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": "100 1st Street SW", "city": "Albuquerque", "subcity": "Raynolds Addition", "county": "Bernalillo County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on 1st Street SW north of Gold Avenue SW, on the right when traveling north.

Local citizens contributed lumber for the project, and in addition 735 sheep, 2 goats, 2 oxen and 1 heifer to the building fund. The original stucco was a cementitious scored application suggesting stone masonry construction. The current paint colors are based on the building's original Victorian Era paint color palette.\n\nFire destroyed the third floor on November 30, 1926. Repairs were made and the building was reoccupied after the holidays. The third floor was never rebuilt and the building was left with a flat roof.\n\nThe building was remodeled in the 1950's in the Territorial Revival style that had become an accepted regional style for public building at that time. The brick coping and espada\u00f1a (bell mount) were added as part of the 1950's remodeling. St. Michael's High School moved to its current location on Siringo Road and the Lamy Building was converted to a State Government office building.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 165958, "filename": "165958.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Lamy Building Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 165959, "filename": "165959.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Lamy Building Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 165961, "filename": "165961.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Lamy Building Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 165962, "filename": "165962.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Lamy Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.93798, 35.68342]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 45655, "number": null, "title": "J\u00e9mez Mountains", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": null, "city": "Santa Fe", "subcity": null, "county": "Santa Fe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on State Road 502 at milepost 13.5,, 0.9 miles east of Povi Kaa Drive, on the right when traveling west.

In the 1850's, a stage line was established from Las Vegas to White Oaks and Fort Stanton, transporting passengers, mail & supplies for the army from Ft. Union to Ft. Stanton. Among the stage stops were Pinos Wells, Red Cloud Post Office, and Greathouse Tavern. Mining began as early as 1881 in the Red Cloud area of the Gallinas mountains, but proved to be unprofitable because miners had to haul their ore by wagon to smelters in Soccoro and El Paso. With the establishment of rail lines through Corona, increased ore production became possible. At the peak of mining production, approximately 300 people were employed in the industry. Corona was established as a railroad town in 1903 with the building of the El Paso and South Western Railroad from Carrizozo to Santa Rosa where it connected to the Rock Island Line. This brought many homesteaders and farmers to the area and initiated the growth of Corona as a trade center, enabling farmers and ranchers to ship their products to market. In the 1950's, natural gas transmission lines were laid through the area, company housing was built, and some thirty families were employed. Recognized as one of the best in the state, the school has long been the focal point of the community. The district encompasses parts of three counties and serves an area of 2061 square miles. The stage lines are now gone, the mines are closed; farming is minimal; the railroad depot has been moved; trains no longer stop here and the natural gas lines have been automated. Corona is still the trade center for the area; the school is still the heart of the community; and Corona is, once again, ranching country.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 167044, "filename": "167044.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 24, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Corona, New Mexico Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 167045, "filename": "167045.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 24, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Corona, New Mexico Marker", "subcaption": "This is the south side of the marker.

Of the 58 timber frame trestles along the \"Cloud-Climbing Railroad\", this trestle is the last that remains standing.\n \nEngineering studies began in 1989, and through the efforts of volunteers, organizations, agencies, and New Mexico Congressman Stevan Pearce, restoration started in 2009. In 2010, the trestle again looked as it had during Southern Pacific ownership in 1937-1947.\n\nTimber frame trestles like the Mexican Canyon Trestle are comprised of a series of structures called bents. Each bent is made up of strong timbers that served specific roles in supporting the weight of the train and keeping the trestle from swaying.\n\nBy the 1980s a dip in the center of the trestle formed as several vertical timbers began crushing the two rotten mid-sills between them at bents 10 and 11. Almost equally rotten bracing held the trestle together in the center. In 2008 even as Forest Service employees and volunteers prepared the construction site, the trestle collapsed at its north end.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 219264, "filename": "219264.jpeg", "photographer": "Wyndfire", "taken": null, "submitted": "September 4, 2012, by Jennifer W. of Las Cruces, New Mexico.", "caption": "Restoring a Local Treasure Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 219265, "filename": "219265.jpeg", "photographer": "Wyndfire", "taken": null, "submitted": "September 4, 2012, by Jennifer W. of Las Cruces, New Mexico.", "caption": "Cloudcroft Trestle", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272215, "filename": "272215.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Mexican Canyon Trestle", "subcaption": "_x000D_\nThis property", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272216, "filename": "272216.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Mexican Canyon Trestle", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.74782, 32.9643]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 59629, "number": null, "title": "Harriet Belle Amsden Sammons (1876-1954)", "subtitle": "Bank President", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "New Mexico Womens Initiative", "address": null, "city": "Farmington", "subcity": null, "county": "San Juan County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of Browning Parkway and Burnham Road, on the right when traveling south on Browning Parkway.

The influence of french priests changed some of the interior decoration, but the church has retained much of its original look through its 150 years. Major structural collapse in 1979 prompted a decision to restore the structure because of its historical importance as the cradle of Catholicism throughout Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado. The reconstruction, completed in 1982, attempted to restore much of the original colonial Hispanic artwork and spirituality.

It became the most important settlement in the area outside of the ancient San Ger\u00f3nimo de Taos Pueblo three miles north of here.\n\nIn the late 1700\u2019s, families on the land grant built their homes and businesses around this plaza so that the windowless rear walls provided a secure defensive structure. There were strong gates at both ends. In times of war, when a threat was reported by outlying sentinels, livestock was brought into the plaza for safekeeping. A well in the center of the plaza provided water.\n\nIn peaceful times, the plaza served as a gathering place as it still does today, for church processions, political speeches, horse trading, music, assembly of militia, farmers market and small talk. Wagons probably didn\u2019t reach Taos until the mid 1800s, and so for many years trains of pack animals were\nfrequently seen on the plaza with trade goods such as furs being unloaded for inspection at the customs house, or local products being packed for trading with faraway destinations throughout the west.\n\nAs commerce grew, the plaza became the site for Taos\u2019 early hotels, such as the Don Fernando and the Columbian, both long gone. A courthouse and jail occupied a site on the north side starting about 1830. Over the years a few saloons and gambling establishments did a brisk business here. During the bloody rebellion against U.S. occupation in 1847, fighting took place in and around the plaza, and then after hasty trials, several executions took place here.\n\nFrom time to time raging fires destroyed important buildings, and the replacements often changed the appearance of the plaza. In 1932 a new Taos County Courthouse was built after a fire destroyed an earlier court building and jail, along with other establishments on the north side. Today this Old Courthouse situated across the road behind you displays WPA murals by some of the early artists who helped make Taos a famous art colony.\n\nThrough the years as seen in these photographs, the town has changed many times, but the presence and spirit of olden days can still be felt.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 246673, "filename": "246673.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

He expanded his curriculum to include courses in civil law, establishing the first law school in New Mexico. In 1836 Padre Mart\u00ednez obtained the first printing press in New Mexico and printed grammar, mathematics, and law books for his schools. He also printed circulars on issues of popular discourse and resumed publishing the regional newspaper, El Crepusculo de la Libertad.\n\nMartinez\u2019 career as a political leader was equally impressive. Under Mexican governments, he was he was elected to the New Mexico Departmental Assembly, and served in the Assembly in 1830-31, 1836-37, and 1846-46. In December 1847 his name headed a formal petition seeking annexation of New Mexico to the United States, and in 1848 he presided over the convention to organize and establish New Mexico as a US Territory. He presided over the New Mexico Constitutional Convention of 1860, served as President of the Upper House of the Legislative Assembly in 1851, and later served as a member of both Upper and Lower Houses of the Legislature.\n\nHis role as a religious leader began four years after the death of his wife in 1813, when he traveled to Durango, Mexico, where he studied at the Tridentine Seminary. He returned to New Mexico as one of its only native-born Catholic clergy and served as parish priest in Taos from 1826-1858.\n\nUpon his death on July 27, 1867 the New Mexico Territorial Legislative Council issued a proclamation recognizing Padre Mart\u00ednez as \u201cThe Honor of his Homeland.\u201d That tribute is most appropriately reprised as a memorial with this memorial in the center of the Taos Plaza that was dedicated on July 16, 2006.\n\nSan Luis, Colorado, sculptor, Huberto Maestas, created this bronze memorial with funding by the 2002 New Mexico State Legislature, SB 6, introduced by Sen.

La vida del presb\u00edtero Don Antonio Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez se extiende a trav\u00e9s de las etapas espa\u00f1olas (1793-1820), mejicanas (1821-1848) y estadounidenses en la historia de Nuevo M\u00e9jico durante la turbulencia del Siglo XIX. En cada una de estas epocas, el Padre Martinez hizo permanentes contribuciones a la educaci\u00f3n, religi\u00f3n y a la pol\u00edtica de estos tiempos. A pesar de que fue, sin duda, uno de los m\u00e1s influyentes Hispanos en la historia de Nuevo M\u00e9jico en el Siglo XIX.\n\nComo educador y editor, el Padre Martinez estableci\u00f3 el primer colegio educativo y primario en Taos en el 1828, y en el 1833 tambi\u00e9n estableci\u00f3 un colegio preparatorio en Lat\u00edn para seminaristas prospectivos, nativos de Nuevo M\u00e9jico. Expandi\u00f3 su curriculum para tambi\u00e9n incluir cursos en las leyes civiles, estableciendo la primera escuela de ley en Nuevo M\u00e9jico. En 1835, el Padre Mart\u00ednez obtuvo la primera prensa de imprimir en Nuevo M\u00e9jico e imprimi\u00f3 libros de gram\u00e1tica, de matem\u00e1tica y de leyes para sus colegios. Tambi\u00e9n, imprimi\u00f3 circulares sobre cuestiones de discurso popular y resumi\u00f3 publicando el peri\u00f3dico regional \u201cEl Crep\u00fasculo de la Libertad.\u201d\n\nLa carrera del Padre Mart\u00ednez como l\u00edder politico tambi\u00e9n fue impresionante.

En diciembre del 1847, su nombre encabez\u00f3 la petici\u00f3n formal que buscaba la anexi\u00f3n de Nuevo M\u00e9jico a los Estados Unidos, y en 1848 presidi\u00f3 sobre la convenci\u00f3n para organizar y establecer a Nuevo M\u00e9jico como Territorio de los Estados Unidos. Tambi\u00e9n presidi\u00f3 sobre la Convenci\u00f3n Constitucional de Nuevo M\u00e9jico en 1850, sirviendo como el Presidente de la C\u00e1mara Alta de la Asamblea Legislativa en 1851 y despu\u00e9s sirviendo como miembro de ambas C\u00e1maras Altas y Bajas de la Legislatura.\n\nEl papel del Padre Mart\u00ednez como l\u00edder religioso se inici\u00f3 cuatro a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de la muerte de su mujer en 1813, cuando Antonio Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn y Santistevan viaj\u00f3 a Durango, M\u00e9jico, donde estudi\u00f3 en el Seminario Tridentino ubicado all\u00ed. Regres\u00f3 a Nuevo M\u00e9jico estableci\u00e9ndose como uno de los \u00fanicos nativos en la clerec\u00eda Cat\u00f3lica, sirviendo como el p\u00e1rroco de Taos desde 1826 hasta 1858.\n\nAl morir el 27 de julio del 1887, el Concilio Legislativo Territorial de Nuevo M\u00e9jico difundi\u00f3 una proclamaci\u00f3n en reconocimiento del Padre Mart\u00ednez como \u201cLa Honra de su Pa\u00eds.\u201d Este tributo hoy en dia se ha repetido como monumento conmemorativo en esta estatua de tama\u00f1o natural del Padre, ubicada en el Centro de la Plaza Taos, Nuevo M\u00e9jico, dedicada el 16 de julio del 2006.\n\nEl escultor, Huberto Maestas, de San Luis, Colorado, ha creado este monumento de bronce con el patrocinio de la Legislatura del estado de Nuevo M\u00e9jico 2002, proyecto de ley 6, introducido por el Senador Carlos R.

The two-hundred- year-old Taos Plaza, including the streets that radiate from it like spokes, forms the National Historic District of Taos. A number of national and state landmarks, which are located in the district, are testimonials to the rich and complex cultural history of Taos.\n\nThe Taos Valley has been a major trade and travel route since human presence was first felt in the area. Archeological evidence suggests that people have been using and moving through the Taos Valley for at least the past 9,000 years. The ancestors of the Pueblo people, commonly known as the Anasazi, were the first permanent inhabitants of the Valley. Room blocks and pit houses in the Taos area testify to their presence since 900 AD. Around 1200 AD, the Anasazi aggregated into small, above-ground structures of 50 to 100 rooms. The Taos Pueblo was constructed around 1450 AD as a multi-story complex. The Pueblo Indians depended upon nature for their survival, and therefore, treated nature as an organizing element in their lives.\n\nAt the time of the arrival of the Europeans, all of Taos Valley was in the domain of Taos Pueblo Indians. In 1540, a Spanish conquistador named Francisco De Coronado led an expedition into New Mexico, looking for gold and silver. After experiencing much resistance from the Pueblos of the region, no further expeditions were authorized until 1598, when Don Juan de Onate established a colonial capital at the current San Juan Pueblo. During the 1600s, the Spanish strengthened their control in the Taos Valley and settled in large plantations bordering the Rio Grand River. For many years, battles and revolts existed between the two clashing cultures. The Spanish were driven out of Taos at one point, and the resettlement and reestablishment of Spanish civil government in the Taos Valley did not occur again until 1715. After that time, Spanish focus shifted from acquisition and exploitation to permanent settlement.\n\nWith this new focus, Hispano settlers interacted extensively with the Pueblo and other Indian neighbors. The three groups engaged in trading, both informally and through trade fairs. Hispanos brought many new types of fruits and vegetables into the Taos Valley; they also introduced livestock to the Pueblos. They took over and expanded abandoned Pueblo irrigation systems and renamed them acequias, an Arabic word meaning irrigation ditch. The Pueblos taught the Hispanos to build with mud and timber and adopted the Hispanos\u2019 adobe brick molds and \u201chorno\u201d ovens brought from Spain. The land grant system, initiated by the Spanish, blended with the Pueblo tradition and evolved into the current style of the central plaza and the surrounding buildings and churches, for which the Taos Valley is now known.\n\nAfter periods of Mexican rule, the area was claimed as a territory for the United States in 1846. President Fillmore established New Mexico as an official territory in 1850, and Taos became a county in 1852. The Taos Valley flourished during this period, and other cultures found their way into the territory. Taos was a very solid trade center for the region.\n\nIn 1898, two young artists from the East, named Ernest Blumenshein and Bert Phillips, discovered the Valley after their wagon broke down north of Taos. They decide to stay, captivated by the beauty of the area. As word of their discovery spread throughout the art community, they were joined by other associates. In 1915, six artists formed\nthe Taos Society of Artists. Soon other intellectuals such as Mabel Dodge Luhan and D.H. Lawrence, joined the Taos scene, adding greatly to the social and intellectual life of the community. To date, Taos is known world-wide by artists, art patrons, and inquisitive minds who continue to find a mecca of inspiration here.\n\nThe history of Taos is a story of change, adaptation, and the integration of three cultures that both complicate and enrich the reality in which Taosenos live today. You are invited to explore a small part of this rich history and culture with the Taos Historic District\u2019s self-guided tour. The map and brochures will assist you in your journey.\n\nWelcome to Taos, Bien Venidos, and Na-Tah-La-Wamah.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 247232, "filename": "247232.jpeg", "photographer": "J. J.

Most of the turquoise uncovered at area archaeological sites as well as some discovered in Chaco Canyon probably came from the Cerrillos Hills. For almost 400 years starting in the early 1300s, the people from large pueblos such as San Marcos came to these hills for galena, a lead ore they used for the detective black glaze decorations on their pots. Cerrillos galena became the preferred glaze for potters throughout the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n\nThe Spanish, too, valued galena, but more for its silver content. Their first reference to the Cerrillos Hills dates from the Entrada of 1581, when two miner-soldiers claim to have discovered 11 silver veins here. Although stories were told about rich cities of gold in El Norte, and silver, the early Spaniards found no evidence in the pueblos that either of these metals were mined. The oldest well-documented mine claim in New Mexico (there were older records, but they were destroyed in the uprising of 1680) is the 1709 claim for the nearby Santa Rosa galena-silver mine.\n\u2003\n\nMost of the 4,000 holes, pits, and shafts visible in the Hills today are the remains of the Mining Book of 1879-1884, when Anglos living in the western territories, speculators from the East, and recent European immigrants flocked to the Hills, digging for riches they hoped would rival the California and Colorado gold strikes.\n\n\nTo the people of Santa Fe County, who approved the 1998 bond that funded the purchase of these 1116 acres, thank you! The New Mexico State Abandoned Mine Land Bureau secured the deepest mine shafts, and the Santa Fe County Cerrillos Hills Historic Park opened in 2003.

In 1610 Governor Pedro de Peralta relocated the capital of the province to Santa Fe. Between 1610 and 1680, colonists moved into New Mexico, living primarily along the Rio Grande. Franciscan friars established missions at most of the Indian pueblos. Life was not always peaceful. In order to regain control of their homeland, in 1680, many pueblo people, led by Pop\u00e9, a San Juan Indian, united to drive the colonists out. Twenty-one Franciscan friars and numerous colonists were killed in what has come to be called the Pueblo Revolt. The rest of the settlerss fled south to El Paso del Norte. It was not until 1693 that the province was resettled under the leadership of Governor Diego de Vargas. \n\nThe cross, which commemorates the deaths of the friars and colonists, was designed by Ralph Emerson Twitchell, Edgar L. Street, and Warren G. Turley. It was constructed of reinforced concrete by the Midland Bridge Company, stands 25 feet high, is eight feet in depth, and weighs 76 tons. The cross was dedicated during the Santa Fe Fiesta in 1920. Another Cross of the Martyrs has been erected on Fort Marcy Hill by the Fiesta Council.\n\nEn 1598, pobladores Espa\u00f1oles, dirigidos por Juan de O\u00f1ate, de Zacatecas, M\u00e9xico, establecieron una colonia al lado del Rio Grande en un sitio localizado al norte de la presente ciudad de Espa\u00f1ola. En 1610, el Gobernador Pedro de Peralta cambi\u00f3 la capital de la provincia a Santa Fe. Desde 1610 hasta 1680, colonos vinieron a vivir en Nuevo M\u00e9xico principalmente en los m\u00e1rgenes del Rio Grande. Friales Franciscanos establecieron misiones en casi todos los pueblos Indios, pero no siempre fue la vida placible. En 1680, la mayor\u00eda de estos pueblos ind\u00edgenos, dirigidos por Pop\u00e9, se juntaron para establecer su propia autoridad sobre este pa\u00eds, y echaron afuera los colonos espa\u00f1oles. 21 frailes y n\u00fameros colonos murieron en lo que hoy le dicen \u201cLa Rebeli\u00f3n de los Pueblos.\u201d Los sobrevivientes colonos se escaparon para El Paso del Norte. No regresaron los espa\u00f1oles a esta provincia hasta 1693, bajo la direcci\u00f3n del Gobernador Diego de Vargas.\n\nEsta cruz, una conmemoraci\u00f3n de la muerte de los frailes y colonos, fue dise\u00f1ada por Ralph Emerson Twitchell, Edgar L.

The artist designed Sallie Chisum from several photographs taken of her throughout her life. Because photographs did not show adequate detail of her clothing, the artist designed her clothes from images in a 1902 Sears catalog, a place Sallie may have shopped. \n\nThe children in the sculpture are based on two children seen in a 1908 photograph of school children on the playground at Artesia's original Central School. The book Sallie holds was published years after her encounters with Billy the Kid, but reflects their brief history. The book is titled \"An Authentic Life of Billy the Kid \u2013 The Noted Desperado of the Southwest.\" Its cover also notes the author: \"By Pat Garrett, the Sheriff of Lincoln County at Whose Hands He Was Killed.\" The dime novel was published in 1882.\n\nQueen of the Jinglebob\n\nThe niece of famed cattleman John Chisum, Sallie Chisum moved to her uncle's Jinglebob Ranch in Southeast New Mexico with her father and brothers after her mother died in 1877. There she became an experienced horsewoman and learned the skills of a rancher. Because her uncle never married, she also cared for the home and family. She eventually married William Robert, her uncle's accountant, and had two surviving children. Because of her skill and charm, she became known as Queen of the Jinglebob.\n\nAngel of Mercy\n\nAfter a failed marriage, Sallie Chisum filed a homestead and drilled the first artesian water well in 1890 within the boundaries of present day Artesia. Sallie was one of the first traders in the real estate market in Artesia, established and operated Artesia's first post office with her second husband, and, after a second divorce, ran a boarding house for railroad immigrants and travelers to the area. She was a businesswoman, caregiver to the sick and ailing, and a companion to children, although her own children were taken by their father to Europe. During her years of service to the community of Artesia, she often was called the Angel of Mercy.\n\nFirst Lady of Artesia\n\nThe third of three homes built by Sallie Chisum in Artesia remains on Texas Avenue and is listed on the National Trust for Historic Places. Sallie Chisum left Artesia in 1919 and, after a brief stay in California, settled in Roswell where she made her home until she died in 1934. Her accomplishments in Artesia as an entrepreneur, developer and woman led her to be known posthumously as First Lady of Artesia. \n\nBilly the Kid\n\nSallie Chisum's early years on the Jinglebob included visits from the infamous William H. Bonney, also known as Billy the Kid. Although often on the run, The Kid was known to travel miles on horseback just to visit the young and striking Sallie on the Jinglebob Ranch. She made mention of Billy the Kid in her diaries, once noting that he brought her candies.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 272226, "filename": "272226.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272235, "filename": "272235.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272227, "filename": "272227.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272228, "filename": "272228.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272232, "filename": "272232.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272234, "filename": "272234.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272236, "filename": "272236.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 4, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "First Lady of Artesia", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-104.39953, 32.84211]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 73451, "number": null, "title": "John Simpson Chisum", "subtitle": "1824-1884", "subsubtitle": "\"Cattle King of the Pecos\"", "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": null, "city": "Roswell", "subcity": null, "county": "Chaves County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on North Main Street, on the right when traveling south.

He established headquarters on the Pecos River at Bosque Grande between Fort Sumner and Roswell, claiming a range from Fort Sumner south 150 miles to Seven Rivers, near present day Carlsbad. In 1875, he moved his headquarters to South Springs at the southern edge of Roswell village. \n\nIn spite of Indian raids, rustling gangs, drought and occasional floods, Chisum's holdings prospered.

Six feet, five inches tall, he was an imposing and implacable foe of western criminals. An honest and honorable lawman, Garrett was much more than the \"Slayer of Billy the Kid.\" A dreamer who was a major figure in the success of agri-business in the Pecos Valley, he was also an important figure in New Mexico and Texas politics.\n\nGarrett became sheriff when trailing and dispatching of a group of Comanche raiders impressed Roswell's J.C. Lea and John Chisum who were searching for an effective sheriff to rid the area of outlaw gangs, especially a young malcreant called \"Billy the Kid.\" Although he was successful in capturing the young outlaw, his efforts were marred by the youth's subsequent escape from the Lincoln County Courthouse after killing his two jailers.\n\nThe sheriffs \"Ride to Destiny\" began in early July 1881, when with his two deputies, he mounted his horse, checked his favorite pistol (a single-action 44-40 Colt), and rode the 80 miles to Fort Sumner. There at the nearby Maxwell Ranch near midnight on July 14, 1881 he met and dispatched Billy the Kid with a bullet through the heart, an incident which often haunted him for the rest of his life.\n\n\nThe killing was controversial and Garrett failed in his re-election bid. He retired to a large plot of land granted him by Roswell's town fathers as an incentive to become sheriff. Although it was his desire to become a gentleman farmer, he soon became a principal in a large water project which proposed using dams and canals to move water throughout the lower Pecos Valley.\n\nAlthough partially successful in boosting agri-business for the area, Garrett was not financially able to meet requirements of the project and soon returned to law enforcement, politics and horse trading.\n \nHe associated with the great and near-great of the region, ran for public office unsuccessfully, headed a group of rangers, tried ranching and occasionally raised fast horses. When Colonel Albert Fountain and his son disappeared in the White Sands area, Garrett accepted the task of identifying and prosecuting the alleged murderers. Although he was successful in identifying the supposed killers, political maneuvering led to freeing the accused perpetrators.\n\nGarrett later became a customs official in El Paso in an appointment by President Theodore Roosevelt. After his term he retired to a small ranch east of Las Cruces and leased some of his land to a young man named Wayne Brazel. The introduction of goat herds on the land led to violent arguments. On February 29, 1908, Garrett was shot in the back and killed by Brazel while en-route to Las Cruces. Brazel was tried and found \"not guilty\" by reason of self defense.\n\n\"He brought law and order to New Mexico,\" President Theodore Roosevelt said when he heard of the death of the famed lawman. The storied frontier sheriff was buried in Las Cruces. The grave bears a simple stone engraved \"GARRETT\". This statue is the only known recognition of his services as an early lawman.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 272301, "filename": "272301.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 5, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272302, "filename": "272302.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 5, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett Marker and Statue", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 272304, "filename": "272304.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 5, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett Statue", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3000, "height": 4000, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 272303, "filename": "272303.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 5, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett Marker", "subcaption": "Plaque on statue reads", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4000, "height": 3000, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 302014, "filename": "302014.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "April 27, 2014", "submitted": "May 5, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett Statue", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3000, "height": 4000, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-104.52092, 33.39711]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 73453, "number": null, "title": "Roswell", "subtitle": "Population 50,000 - Elevation 3,612", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "New Mexico Historic Preservation Division", "address": null, "city": "Roswell", "subcity": null, "county": "Chaves County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on East Second Street, on the right when traveling west.

He mailed the bones to\npaleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in Philadelphia. Cope had been through the area in the late 1870s and had urged Baldwin to explore and see what he could collect. In 1889 Cope named the little dinosaur Coelophysis bauri after Georg Baur, a German morphologist. (Coelophysis means \u201chollow form,\u201d referring to the lightly constructed bones.)\n\nIn June 1947, a field crew led by Edwin H. Colbert from\nthe American Museum of Natural History in New York\nstopped at Ghost Ranch on their way to Petrified Forest\nNational Monument in Arizona. They knew that Baldwin and\nother paleontologists had discovered fossils in the area.\nThey soon found fragments of fossilized bone that they\nrecognized were from the small dinosaur, Coelophysis.\n\nHoping to find a partial skeleton, Colbert and his\ncrew carefully dug into the hillside. Instead of a partial\nskeleton they found a dense bone bed of hundreds of\npreserved skeletons. Because the skeletons overlapped\neach other, they had to excavate the fossils in large\nblocks of rock. They encased 13 blocks in plaster field\njackets, each of which contained numerous whole and\npartial skeletons.\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, field crews from the Carnegie\nMuseum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, and other\ninstitutions, collected 15 large blocks from the quarry.\nIn 1983 another large block was excavated by the\nNew Mexico Museum of Natural History. The last\nblock was excavated in 1985 and is on display at the\nRuth Hall Museum at Ghost Ranch.\n\n(sidebar) \nDid You Know?\n\n\u2022 1976 \u2013 Ghost Ranch\u2019s Coelophysis\nQuarry was designated a National\nNatural Landmark by the National\nPark Service.\n\n\u2022 1981 \u2013The New Mexico State\nLegislature named Coelophysis the\nNew Mexico State Fossil beating\nout Brontosaurus.\n\n\u2022 1998 \u2013 Coelophysis was the second\n dinosaur in space when it traveled\non NASA's Endeavor Space Shuttle.\nA Coelophysis skull, quarried at Ghost\nRanch, was sent to space by the\nCarnegie Museum of Natural\nHistory. It left Earth on January 22\nand returned on January 31.\n\n(credits) This project was made possible by a grant from the National Park Foundation through the generous support of ARAMARK and the Yawkey Foundation, the Fernandez Pave the Way Foundation, and The History Channel. Partners were The Army Corps of Engineers, Ghost Ranch Youth Service Corps, and Willie Picaro.

Tucked away in the beautiful Bonito River Valley, Lincoln has barely changed since the Lincoln County War (1878-1881). Lincoln is considered by many historians to be the most authentic old west town remaining in the United States. A host of characters, including Billy the Kid, launched the little hamlet into the history books. Lincoln\u2019s story brings with it the dubious distinction of having been the most violent town in western American history. President Rutherford B. Hayes once called the single road through Lincoln \u201cthe most dangerous street in America.\u201d Here is a tale fueled by ambition, greed, corruption and violence, dripping in political intrigue, which spilled over to the state capital in Santa Fe and made national headlines.Although Billy the Kid was the most famous character in Lincoln during its historic heyday, he had only a supporting role in the larger story\u2026 the Lincoln County War. The War was a capitalistic struggle that took root in 1877 when a wealthy young Englishman, John H. Tunstall, saw an opportunity to establish a mercantile store in Lincoln and compete with the monopoly that L. G. Murphy and Company had established. Murphy and his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, James J. Dolan, were backed by powerful politicians who were also investors and a deputized group of gunmen known as \u201cThe Boys.\u201d Tunstall was soon murdered for his efforts and his allies, that included Alexander McSween, Billy the Kid and cattle baron John S. Chisum, sought revenge by forming their own arm of the law called \u201cThe Regulators.\u201d County residents chose up sides and anarchy reigned.Of all the murders, thefts and property destruction that occurred during the Lincoln County War, only one man, William H. Bonney\u2026 Billy the Kid, was ever tried, convicted and sentenced. This was for the murder of Sheriff Will Brady. He was to hang in Lincoln on May 13, 1881, but made his famous escape from the courthouse (now a museum), killing his two guards on April 28, 1881.Today, Lincoln\u2019s idyllic and picturesque setting belies its violent past. Lincoln State Monument, a National Historic Landmark, preserves 16 historic adobe and stone buildings. As you take a relaxing stroll in the footsteps of Billy the Kid, Sheriff Pat Garrett, Kit Carson, John Chisum and General John J. \u201cBlackjack\u201d Pershing you can visit six museums and see the famous town much as it looked during the Lincoln County War.

Just a stone's throw from where you now stand, in Milligan's Saloon, a man known as El Burro was brutally tortured and Epitacio Martinez, coming to the aid of his friend, was bound and shot for target practice. Both men lived. The Frisco deputy sheriff, Pedro Sarracino, outnumbered and overwhelmed, rode to Socorro for help. Nineteen year old deputy Elfego Baca rode back to Frisco with Sarracino intent on seeking justice.\n\nThree days later, Baca observed one cowboy butting another one on the head and firing several rounds with his pistol. Justice of the Peace Lopez stood by hopelessly, saying the Slaughter outfit had 150 cowboys on their payroll and could not be stopped. Determined and fearless, Baca promptly arrested the cowboy. A large group of cowboys gathered and demanded his release. Baca shot into the group wounding one man and they dispersed. But the following day, 80 enraged ranch hands rode into the town, intent on freeing the arrested cowboy and avenging the indignity of his arrest. A trial was held and the cowboy was released. Baca, sensing a gunfight, retreated to a jacal belonging to Geronimo Armijo and barricaded himself inside. Baca kept his six-shooter blazing for 36 hours, pausing just long enough to cook some tortillas and beef stew. Protected by mud and picket walls,a sunken floor and an icon of Nuestra Senora Santa Anna, Baca braved dynamite and some 4,000 rounds of gunfire shot in his direction by the Texas cowboys.\n\nOn the third day, Baca agreed to give himself up to deputy Ross from Socorro but refused to turn over his guns. Baca, unscathed throughout the gunfight, had killed two cowboys and wounded two more. \n\nThe atrocities stopped.\n\nThis memorial has been constructed under the leadership of Henry Martinez (great-grandson of Epitacio Martinez), by the Elfego Baca Project, Inc. and Catron County with a grant from the State of New Mexico, to commemorate the life and honor the bravery of Elfego Baca.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 205876, "filename": "205876.jpeg", "photographer": "Tceng", "taken": "May 27, 2012", "submitted": "June 2, 2012, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "Elfego Baca Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2560, "height": 1920, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 207019, "filename": "207019.jpeg", "photographer": "Tceng", "taken": "June 9, 2012", "submitted": "June 9, 2012, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "Elfego Baca Marker and Sculpture", "subcaption": "A firefighter from the 2012 Whitewater-Baldy Complex, largest fire in New Mexico history to date, pauses to read the marker before heading out to complete final mop-up of the fire.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2560, "height": 1920, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 205877, "filename": "205877.jpeg", "photographer": "Tceng", "taken": "May 27, 2012", "submitted": "June 2, 2012, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "Elfego Baca Marker and Sculpture", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2560, "height": 1920, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 206011, "filename": "206011.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "May 30, 2012", "submitted": "June 3, 2012.", "caption": "Detail on the Elfego Baca Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 777, "height": 965, "aspect": 0.805181347150259}, {"photo_id": 205875, "filename": "205875.jpeg", "photographer": "Tceng", "taken": "May 27, 2012", "submitted": "June 2, 2012, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "Elfego Baca Monument", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2560, "height": 1920, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 207018, "filename": "207018.jpeg", "photographer": "Tceng", "taken": "June 9, 2012", "submitted": "June 9, 2012, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "The Complete Elfego Baca Monument", "subcaption": "Viewed from the South.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2560, "height": 1920, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 207020, "filename": "207020.jpeg", "photographer": "Tceng", "taken": "September 6, 2012", "submitted": "June 9, 2012, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "Elfego Baca Marker", "subcaption": "Detail, James Muir's Award-Winng Sculpture", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1920, "height": 2560, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-108.75809, 33.71293]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 88749, "number": null, "title": "Santa-Fe Trail", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1930, "erected_by": "the Colorado & Southern Railway.", "address": "US-64", "city": "Grenville", "subcity": null, "county": "Union County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 64, 0.3 miles south of 1st Street (State Road 453), on the left when traveling south.

Begun in 1821, it was in use for 60 years until the arrival of the railroad. It was a hardy traveler who attempted the journey. Wagon trains up to 500 wagons long traversed the trail through blizzards, stampedes, dust storms, fires, disease, and Indian attacks.

That location was flooded, and the small settlement was moved about a mile to the southwest. It was moved again in 1882 to the present location after the discovery of an amazingly large and pure silver ore body. The deposit was christened the \"Bridal Chamber\" because of the sparkle from its crystal encrusted walls. \n\nLake Valley during the 1880's and early 1890's had a population up to 4,000 people, over a dozen saloons and newspapers, general stores, businesses, and hotels. After the bust of 1893, it became a virtual ghost town. Then, in 1895, the Main Street business district burned.\n\nAn influenza epidemic in 1918 dealt a further blow, only to be followed by the Great Depression of the 1930's. As part of the nation's Work Projects, a road, now abandoned, was built from Lake Valley due east to the Rio Grande River. Beginning in the 1920's, and as recently as the 1950's, manganese, an ingredient necessary to make high quality steel, was mined at Lake Valley.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 361497, "filename": "361497.jpeg", "photographer": "Wyndfire", "taken": "July 3, 2016", "submitted": "September 3, 2016, by Jennifer W. of Las Cruces, New Mexico.", "caption": "Lake Valley Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 361498, "filename": "361498.jpeg", "photographer": "Wyndfire", "taken": "July 3, 2016", "submitted": "September 3, 2016, by Jennifer W. of Las Cruces, New Mexico.", "caption": "Lake Valley ghost town", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-107.56748, 32.71498]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 97441, "number": null, "title": "Sadie Orchard", "subtitle": "(1860 - 1943)", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "New Mexico Historic Women Marker Initiative", "address": null, "city": "Hillsboro", "subcity": null, "county": "Sierra County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on Road 152, on the left when traveling east.

Francisco Cuervo Valdez with 30 families from Bernalillo accompanied by soldiers to protect them from nomadic Indians. Spanish custom required the church to be ready when a town was established so it is assumed that the church was also built in 1706. The original church faced east toward the old plaza which extended north and south. After floods and disasters it was remodeled in 1795 much as we see it today. The present plaza dates from American times. In Spanish days the town was often raided by hostile Indians. With the opening of overland trade Albuquerque became an important stop on the Santa Fe \u2013Chihuahua trail.\n\nPresented by\nWoodmen of the World\nApril 1969\n\n\nSecond marker from the left:\nIn 1821 Mexico became independent from Spain and the flag of the Mexican Republic flew over the plaza. Trade began with the U.S. and soon wagons rolled over the Santa Fe Trail from Missouri. They came through Alburquerque on their way to Chihuahua. The wagons brought new products, customs and people. Traders, mountain men and trappers passed through the plaza. In 1846 the Stars and Stripes were raised over the plaza by U.S. troops under Gen. Stephen W. Kearny followed by Col. Doniphan of the Missouri Volunteers and Col. Cooke with the Mormon Batallion. Susan Magoffin lent charm and the Camel Corps a bizarre note as they passed this plaza. Pioneers moved west and Albuquerque was a major town by the time of the Civil War.\n\nPresented by Plaza Business Association\nJune 1969\n\n\nSecond marker from the right:\nMarch 2, 1862, the Union Cavalry commanded by Capt. Herbert Enos abandoned the garrison at Alburquerque, burned buildings, food and materiel and retreated north to Ft. Union. Gen. Henry Sibly, Commander of the Southern Forces entered the city and raised the Confederate Flag over the plaza. Some citizens were pro-south but most were loyal to the U.S. After the defeat of the Confederate Army at Apache Canyon they retreated to Albuquerque. Union General E. R. S. Canby began the bombardment of Albuquerque on April 10, 1862. After several hours he ordered a cease-fire to protect citizens. The Confederates buried their cannons and under cover of darkness left Albuquerque, dispersed as an army and returned to Texas.\n\nPresented by Albuquerque Historical Society July 1969\n\n\n\n\nMarker on the far right:\nAfter the Civil War there was great change in Old Albuquerque but without the lawlessness that marked other frontier towns. It was a supply center for Indians, farmers, ranchers and military posts. Hotels, saloons, dance halls, blacksmith shops, stables and eventually a school and bank joined the old church around the plaza. In 1880 the railroad came but its route lay 2 miles east. Most business moved to new town and a horse drawn street car down Railroad Avenue joined the two Albuquerques. Once again the plaza became a quiet place surrounded by homes, a few stores and always the church. Old Albuquerque became an island of yesterday surrounded by a sea of change and progress and thus it remains today - the historic birthplace of the Duke City \u2013 Albuquerque. \n\nPresented by\nThe Kiwanis Club of Albuquerque\nApril, 1970", "photos": [{"photo_id": 164916, "filename": "164916.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "July 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "San Felipe de Alburquerque Marker", "subcaption": "First marker on the left - presented by the Woodmen of the World.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 164917, "filename": "164917.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "July 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "San Felipe de Alburquerque Marker", "subcaption": "Second marker from the left - Presented by the Plaza Business Association.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 164918, "filename": "164918.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "July 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "San Felipe de Alburquerque Marker", "subcaption": "Second marker from the right - Presented by the Alburquerque Historical Society.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 164919, "filename": "164919.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "July 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "San Felipe de Alburquerque Marker", "subcaption": "Marker on the far right - Presented by the Kiwanis Club of Albuquerque.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 164920, "filename": "164920.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "July 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "San Felipe de Alburquerque Markers", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 164921, "filename": "164921.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "July 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "San Felipe de Alburquerque Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2816, "height": 2112, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 608038, "filename": "608038.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

Sun watching continues to play an integral role in the Pueblo world. Pueblo people use such markers to plan their agriculture, to set the ceremonial calendar, to integrate the physical and spiritual worlds, and to seek balance and harmony for all people.\n\nOur modern interest in this site may have forever impacted it. In 1989, researchers noticed that the light pattern on the spiral had shifted, due to the slight slipping of the slabs.

It was then shipped in\nsections to New Mexico where Ted Brown's\nConstruction Company of Albuquerque assembled it.\n\nGadget\nThe nuclear device detonated at Trinity, nicknamed\n\"Gadget,\u201d was shaped like a large steel globe. Like the\nFat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki, it was a plutonium\nimplosion device. Plutonium implosion devices are more\nefficient and powerful than gun-type uranium bombs like\nthe Little Boy bomb detonated over Hiroshima.\nPlutonium implosion devices use conventional\nexplosives around a central plutonium mass to quickly\nsqueeze and consolidate the plutonium, increasing the\npressure and density of the substance. An increased\ndensity allows the plutonium to reach its critical mass,\nfiring neutrons and allowing the fission chain reaction to\nproceed. To detonate the device, the explosives were\nignited, releasing a shock wave that compressed the\ninner plutonium and led to its explosion.\nCaption:\nNorris Bradbury, group leader for bomb assembly, stands next to the assembled Gadget\natop the 100 foot test tower. Later, he became the director of Los Alamos, after the departure of J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nText of a letter describing the tower's specifications:\nTo: Mr. D. P. Mitchell\nFrom: K. T. Bainbridge\nSubject: Purchase Request No. 8889 for bottom 100 feet of 200-ft. Blaw-Knox Tower, Drawing 722626. Prior Reference AR404\n\nThe special requirements for the 100-ft. Blaw-Knox tower are:\n\n1. The height of the tower shall be approximately 100 ft. to the working platform. This should be the bottom 100 ft. of the 200-ft. tower as given on drawing No. P22626 (Blaw-Knox), plus pyramid or equivalent, i.e., next 12-ft. section, at least 10 ft. higher in order that sheaves can be mounted at the pinnacle for raising 5 tons of equipment centrally, less than 5-1/2 ft. diameter for largest piece, above the 100-ft. level.\n\n2. Platform or floor at approximately 100-ft. height, minimum 15 ft. square with removable section in center to provide 6 ft. diameter clearance through which to hoist equipment; removable section must be capable of supporting 5 tons dead load at central point when in place.\n\n3. Pressed steel stairway with railing and platforms every 25 ft. of height or oftener. \n\n4. The platform at approximately 100 ft. height must have adequate railing for safety and at least 8 ft. head room over most of the floor area. Platform flooring can be wood. Loading around peripheral section will not exceed 6 men\nand one 300-lb. piece of equipment 3 ft. in diameter.\n\n5. Paint finish will be entirely satisfactory; galvanized finish not required.\n\n6. Delivery to Project T siding desired by June 4; absolute latest date, June 15.\n\n7. Want specification of footings for compacted sandy soil on or before April 15. (This will allow procurement of steel for footings in April and pouring by local men or by contract starting May 15.)\n\n8. Can Blaw-Knox furnish field crew to erect tower, or should we approach the Signal Corps for a trained crew? This is essentially an SCR-271.\n\n9.

Clothing, blankets, harness, wheels, shoes, grease, and endless items the Army needed were shipped into this depot, then distributed to forts all over the Southwest. Keeping those blankets, bullets, and beans moving out to the troops depended on thousands of Army mules.\nEvery year Fort Union's chief quartermaster bought tons of locally grown corn, oats, flour, and beef, thousands of cords of firewood, and over 2,600 tons of hay and straw. Heavy military spending from this office changed the local economy from a barter system to a cash-based economy. \nThe upper Mora River valley soon came to be known as \"the breadbasket of the Southwest.\" Ranchers and farmers built many flour mills along the Mora River to grind locally grown wheat into flour for Fort Union.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 519185, "filename": "519185.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 23, 2015", "submitted": "April 28, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Big Business for New Mexico Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3587, "height": 2270, "aspect": 1.58017621145374}, {"photo_id": 519188, "filename": "519188.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "April 28, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "A Post Quartermaster Sergeant, 1880s, in full-dress uniform.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1905, "height": 1074, "aspect": 1.77374301675978}, {"photo_id": 519190, "filename": "519190.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "April 28, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2731, "height": 1690, "aspect": 1.61597633136095}, {"photo_id": 519187, "filename": "519187.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 23, 2015", "submitted": "April 28, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Big Business for New Mexico Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4806, "height": 3428, "aspect": 1.40198366394399}, {"photo_id": 519192, "filename": "519192.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 23, 2015", "submitted": "April 28, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Fort Union Quartermaster Office Ruins", "subcaption": "(south-side view from near marker)", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4566, "height": 2567, "aspect": 1.77873003506038}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.01569, 35.90852]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 148818, "number": null, "title": "La Junta", "subtitle": "Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Santa Fe Trail Scenic Byway", "address": "2286 New Mexico Highway 161", "city": "Watrous", "subcity": null, "county": "Mora County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on New Mexico Route 161, 0.6 miles south of CanAm Highway (Interstate 25), on the left when traveling south.

We come amongst you as friends \u2014 not as enemies; as protectors not as conquerors. We come among you for your benefit \u2014 not for your injury. Henceforth I absolve you from all allegiance to the Mexican government, and from all obedience to General Armijo. He is no longer your governor [great sensation] I am your governor. I shall not expect you to take up arms and follow me to fight your own people, who may oppose me; but I now tell you, that those who remain peaceably at home, attending to their crops and their herds, shall be protected by me, in their property, their persons, and their religion; not a pepper nor an onion, shall be disturbed or taken by my troops without pay, or by the consent of the owner. But listen! He who promises to be quiet, and is found in arms against me, I will hang. From the Mexican government you have never received protection. The Apaches and Navajos come down from the mountains and carry off your sheep, and even your women, whenever they please. My government will correct all this. It will keep off the Indians, protect you and your persons and property; and, I repeat again, will protect you in your religion. I know you are all great Catholics; that some of your priests have told you all sorts of stories \u2014 that we should ill-treat your women, and brand them on the cheek as you do your mules on the hip. It is all false. My government respects your religion as much as the Protestant religion, and allows each man to worship his Creator as his heart tells him best. The laws protect the Catholic as well as the Protestant the weak as well as the strong; the poor as well as the rich. I am not a Catholic myself \u2014 I was not brought up in that faith; but at least one-third of my army are Catholics, and I respect a good Catholic as much as a good Protestant. There goes my army \u2014 you see but a small portion of it; there are many more behind \u2014 resistance is useless. Mr. Alcalde, and you two captains of militia, the laws of my country require that all men who hold office under me shall take the oath of allegiance.

Every year thousands of travelers and traders passed through Fort Union on the Santa Fe Trail.\nMilitary custom and doctrine fractured this isolated community into three separate \u2014 and often competing \u2014 commands. Regular Army infantry and cavalry officers ran the Post. Quartermaster officers commanded inside the Depot.

The tempo of trade and traffic ratcheted up fast. Soon torrents of American teamsters, settlers, ranchers, miners, and soldiers were coming west.

With Fort Union's firepower, food, and materiel firmly fixed in this part of New Mexico, American Indians suddenly faced hard choices: make war, make peace, or make great changes in their cultures.Some experts estimate that more than 10,000 American Indians once lived where soldiers from Fort Union patrolled.

It is one of the last examples of a homestead cabin of its type on the plateau; most other homesteading properties were destroyed in the Cerro Grande Fire of May 2000.The Romeros lived in this cabin during the growing and stock-raising season, returning to their home in the Rio Grande Valley in winter.

Paleoindians first hunted its forests; millennia later, Pueblo Indians farmed its broad mesas before abandoning their settlements for locations along the Rio Grande. The entry of Spanish explorers into the region in the 15th century laid the foundation for the settlements that were to follow. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hispanic settlers grazed domestic livestock here in the summer, returning the animals to the lowlands as winter approached. After President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act in 1862, families from the Rio Grande Valley began establishing homestead claims on the plateau. In 1887, Juan Luis Garcia filed entry papers for the first homestead to be successfully patented.The challenges were formidable. The plateau was isolated, rugged, and lacked water for irrigation. Yet the homesteaders persisted. They built dwellings and planted crops on their plots of land. They practiced seasonal dry farming, ranching, grazing, and the gathering of native edible plants. In winter, they returned to their permanent homes in nearby valley settlements.Local homesteading as a way of life came to an abrupt end during World War II. In 1943, the U.S. government appropriated much of the Pajarito Plateau for the Manhattan Project. Homesteaders and other private land owners had to sell their lands to the government as part of the war effort; in their place came the men and women who designed and built the world's first atomic bomb.(photo captions)\u2022 The Homestead Act declared that any citizen 21 years of age or older could claim up to 160 acres of surveyed government land. Claimants needed only to improve the plot with a dwelling and grow crops. After five years the property was theirs.\u2022 Homesteader children spent summers on the plateau but attended school in the valley during the winter months, when farming was not possible on the plateau.

That same year, Pond hired Albert J. (A. J.) Connell to be the director of the newly formed Los Alamos Ranch School. The school did not own all the land on Los Alamos Mesa. Much of it was property of the Santa Fe National Forest. Section 16, the so-called school section, which was not open to homesteading, lay in the heart of the school grounds.Connell had worked hard and successfully to build the school into a respected preparatory school for well-to-do boys. Although the school leased land from the forest service, he felt the school would be more secure by owning the land outright.The U.S. Forest Service could not sell land but could trade for land of equal value. Connell sought to buy private land that the forest service wanted to acquire. He found that he could not afford enough private land to trade for the entire 640-acre Section 16. In 1930 he began negotiations to trade 160 acres he had purchased in the Pecos area for 40 acres of Section 16. That tract now includes the east parking lot for Mesa Public Library and a part of Ashley Pond. He completed the transaction in January 1931.Connell was still director of the school when the government began negotiations to acquire the property in 1942. Connell had no choice. It was a wrenching process to lose the place to which he had devoted his heart and soul. He died the following year \u2014 some say \"of a broken heart.\"", "photos": [{"photo_id": 540101, "filename": "540101.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 24, 2015", "submitted": "September 24, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Albert J.

Ever since 1943 the laboratory has been making contributions to fundamental scientific knowledge and to peaceful applications of atomic energy. The world\u2019s first enriched uranium reactor was designed and built at Los Alamos, where it has been in operations since 1944. The world\u2019s first plutonium-fueled reactor went into operation at Los Alamos in 1946. This was also the world\u2019s first fast-neutron reactor. In more recent years the laboratory has developed a reactor using uranium phosphate fuel and another using molten plutonium, both for the first time anywhere. Several rocket propulsion reactors have been built and ground tested, with flight tests scheduled in the next few years.

Although the Turkeys are not volcanic, they have lava flows around their base.The water level is close to the surface even though only 15 inches of rain falls annually, mostly during summer thunderstorms. Harsh spring winds, warm summers, and cold winters influence the balance of a delicate environment.Sangre de Cristo Mountains(Blood of Christ)Often snow-covered, they are the most southern of the Rocky Mountains, rising to an elevation 13,161 feet at Wheeler Peak near Taos, New Mexico.Black Mesa(Black Plateau)This is the remains of an ancient lava flow that covered much of the area. At this location, it covered the Dakota Sandstone as a dark-colored cap rock.Cerro Pelon (Baldy Peak)A cinder cone volcano, rising to an elevation 8,871 feet, is part of the same volcanic activity that created the Black Mesa lava flow.Short Grass PrairiePrimarily composed of blue-grama grass and buffalo grass, these grasslands provided a lush environment for pronghorn, deer, and elk.Water on the PrairieWater is in short supply on the prairie and any source of water is valuable to plants, animal life, and humans.Dakota SandstoneAn uplifted layer of ancient seabed deposits, this stone was used as a crucial weather-resistant building block in the construction of Fort Union. Its porous nature enhanced its capacity to store water.Graneros ShaleA fine-grained shale, washed out from the surrounding hills, fills the valley floor to a depth of about 150 feet. It was an excellent source of clay for making the sun dried adobe bricks used at the fort and community.ForestThe tree covered slopes, rising 2000 feet above the plain, provided lumber used in the fort\u2019s construction. Fort residents also gathered fire wood all year long and hunted game seasonally in the mountains.Turkey MountainsThe Turkey Mountains are blanketed with pi\u00f1on, oneseed and rocky mountain junipers, mountain mahogany, ponderosa pine, and the wavyleaf and gambel oaks.

After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, the Santa Fe trail developed as an international commercial highway connecting Mexico with the United States. It stretched 900 miles from its eastern terminus at Franklin, Missouri, to its western terminus at Santa Fe. Both American and Mexican traders traveled the trail to create new markets and commercial opportunities. When the U.S.-Mexican War ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, freighting along the trail increased, largely due to the need to supply a new system of U.S. military southwestern forts.By 1880, the iron rails of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad replaced the use of the well-worn ruts of the Santa Fe Trail.Today, wagon-wheel ruts, historic buildings, sites, and landmarks that capture both the trail and an era, mark the length of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail. Federal, state, and local agencies, private citizens, and non-profit organizations together protect the remains of the Santa Fe Trail.Preserving the Past for the FutureThe designation of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail in 1987 has led to increased awareness and protection. It has also created opportunities for visitors to experience its route and related sites.

Kearnys GapHere, in 1821, Captain Ignacio Gallego met trader William Becknell's party from Missouri. Mexican independence from Spain two months earlier allowed Governor Facundo Melgares to welcome Becknell and thus open the Santa Fe Trail to legal international commerce between Mexico and the United States.4. Starvation Peak Also known as Bernal Hill, this peak was a landmark for Santa Fe Trail traders. Bernal Spring offered water to traders and for a time there was a stage station nearby.5. San Miguel del VadoThis church was part of the first Hispanic settlement on the trail. Western bound caravans crossed the Pecos River nearby and the crossing point served as a port of entry and campsite for traders headed to Santa Fe.6. Kozlowski\u2019s Stage StationNow part of Pecos National Historical Park, this trading post and stage station was known for its excellent food. It also served as a Union camp during the Civil War battle at Glorieta Pass.[Santa Fe Trail Auto Tour Route logo here]Look for this sign to trace the route of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail.Please be courteous when viewing a site on private land.For maps and further information please visit:\u2022 Fort Union National Monument:www.nps.gov/foun\u2022 Town of Las Vegas, New Mexicowww.lasvegasnewmexico.com \u2022 Las Vegas, New Mexico, Citizens' Committee for Historic Preservation:http://lasbegasnmcchp.com \u2022 Pecos National Historical Park:www.nps.gov/peco \u2022 Information on the Santa Fe Trail:www.santafetrail.orgwww.nps.gov/safe", "photos": [{"photo_id": 540859, "filename": "540859.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 22, 2015", "submitted": "September 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Trail Sites to the West Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4814, "height": 2657, "aspect": 1.8118178396688}, {"photo_id": 540865, "filename": "540865.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "September 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1700, "height": 780, "aspect": 2.17948717948718}, {"photo_id": 540866, "filename": "540866.jpeg", "photographer": "Courtesy Pueblo City-County Library District", "taken": null, "submitted": "September 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "EyewitnessIt was unusual for women to travel the trail.

Near here, the trail split into the Mountain Route and the Cimarron Route and travelers had to decide which to take to continue east to Missouri. The Cimarron Route was the most direct path but lack of water and passage through American Indian lands made it no less hazardous than the Mountain Route. Today both routes are part of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail.1. Wagon MoundOne of the best-known landmarks on the trail, Wagon Mound was the last major point of reference for traders going west. It was so named because it looks like a covered wagon being pulled by oxen.2. Lucien Maxwell House in RayadoStarted by Lucien Maxwell in 1848, the town of Rayado was the point where the Mountain Route and two of its side trails rejoined. The army rented buildings at Rayado in the early 1850s to help protect this part of the Mountain Route.3. CimarronCimarron was an important stop for wagon trains on the Mountain Route. Many buildings, such as the courthouse, jail, stagecoach office, and a gambling house, still remain from that era. The town plaza and well are pictured above.4. Rock Crossing of the Canadian RiverThe rock crossing is less than 10 miles from Springer and was an important crossing used to avoid the deep canyons of the Canadian River.5. Point of RocksUsed as a landmark for traders heading west, Point of Rocks had a fine spring. This outcropping was a popular campsite for various Indian buffalo hunting parties and Santa Fe Trail caravans traveling the Cimarron Route.6. McNees CrossingLocated alongside the North Canadian River. McNees Crossing was a popular camping site. This site is believed to be the location where, in 1831, the Fourth of July was celebrated for the first time in the New Mexico Territory.[Santa Fe Trail Auto Tour Route logo here]Look for this sign to trace the route of the Santa Fe National Historic Trail.Please be courteous when viewing a site on private land.For maps and further information please visit:\u2022 Fort Union National Monument:www.nps.gov/foun\u2022 Wagon Mound:www.wagonmoundnm.com \u2022 Town of Raton:www.ratonnm.gov \u2022 Town of Clayton:www.claytonnewmexico.net  \u2022 Santa Fe Trail information:www.santafetrail.orgwww.nps.gov/safe", "photos": [{"photo_id": 540882, "filename": "540882.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 22, 2015", "submitted": "September 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Trail Sites to the North and East Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4591, "height": 2553, "aspect": 1.79827653740697}, {"photo_id": 540886, "filename": "540886.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "September 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1677, "height": 781, "aspect": 2.14724711907811}, {"photo_id": 540887, "filename": "540887.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "September 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "The Santa Fe Trail was an important link in the system of early international trading routes.

This change in the international boundary allowed for a southern intercontinental railroad route and included some of the richest mineral land in the United States.Mining at Santa Rita continued under a variety of owners, but stopped during the Civil War. With the end of the Apache wars, about 1886, conditions improved and the safety of the miners was guaranteed. It was many more years, however, before copper was profitably mined in this region.The \"Chino Mine\" \u2014 It's All in the NameNamed after the small community of Santa Rita, once located here, the Santa Rita Mine is often referred to as the \"Chino Mine.\" The origin of the name \"Chino,\" however, is not clear. It is believed that the name Chino was derived from a slang Mexican word for quartz. Today, Chino is owned by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 543713, "filename": "543713.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 6, 2014", "submitted": "October 14, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "The Early Mining Years Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4896, "height": 3496, "aspect": 1.40045766590389}, {"photo_id": 543855, "filename": "543855.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 15, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "At a price of 33 cents per acre, nearly 30,000 square miles of land were purchased by the United States from Mexico in 1854.

When the railroad arrived in 1898, it opened a new era for mining. A successful copper mine needed to move tonnage \u2014 lots of tonnage. With the railroad in place, Santa Rita was waiting to be discovered.In 1905, a young M.I.T. graduate named John M. Sully, determined that many small underground mines here were sitting atop an enormous copper ore body of great potential. His systematic and skillful examination of the ore body was followed by his commitment to find funding to develop this great mine. Sully\u2019s success earned him recognition as one of the great engineers of the period.Another contributor to the success of this mine was a young engineer named Daniel C. Jackling. His new method of open-pit mining of large, low-grade copper ore, earned him recognition across the globe.With funding in place and engineering complete, progress was rapid. The Chino Copper Company was formed and the first steam-shovel began open-pit mining in September 1910. In addition, a processing plant was built in 1911 in the nearby community of Hurley. In time, Santa Rita Mine became known as one of the four \u201cJackling properties\u201d where the techniques of open-pit mining were perfected.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 543717, "filename": "543717.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 6, 2014", "submitted": "October 14, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Open Pit Mining Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4841, "height": 3457, "aspect": 1.40034712178189}, {"photo_id": 543889, "filename": "543889.jpeg", "photographer": "Courtesy Silver City Museum", "taken": null, "submitted": "October 15, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "As technology advanced, big steam shovels like this one gave way to massive electric shovels \u2014 linked with long electric cords to nearby substations.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1392, "height": 929, "aspect": 1.4983853606028}, {"photo_id": 543895, "filename": "543895.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 15, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "\"John M.\" was the first general manager at Chino, and to date, the manager with the longest tenure.

The company town of Santa Rita was heavily shaped and influenced by the Hispanic culture that was prevalent in the miners.Unfortunately, the community of Santa Rita was built on top of valuable ore.

Currently, Chino produces about 100 million pounds of copper by this method each year.Lower-grade ore is treated by a \"solution extraction-electrowinning\" process. In this method, a weak acid solution is dripped through stockpiled rock. The dissolved copper solution is collected. In this process, the copper is concentrated from 1.3 grams of copper per liter to 50 grams per liter.

Unlike\nthe emigrant trails to the north, trade\nmoved in both directions.\n\nPioneered in 1821 by William\nBecknell, the trail quickly became a\nbusy trade route handling hundreds\nof wagon trains a year and carrying\ngoods worth millions of dollars in\ntoday's currency. With the arrival of\nthe railroad in 1880, the era of the\nSanta Fe Trail came to an end.\n\nSights nearby\nHertzstein Museum, Clayton\nThis museum, housed in a former church,\noffers informative exhibits about the\nSanta Fe Trail as well as history of the\nLocal area.\n\nPoint of Rocks\nReachable by a private road off of\nHighway 56, this outcropping was an\nimportant landmark and campsite on the\nSanta Fe Trail.\n\nSpringer Museum\nAn informational exhibit here explains\nthe importance of the Santa Fe Trail to\nthe region.\n\nInternational Trade\nRoute\nOpened in 1821 to North American\ntravelers, the trail soon became an\ninternational thoroughfare of commerce\nconnecting Mexico and Santa Fe to eastern\ncities such as New Orleans, New York, and\non to ports in Europe.Who Traveled the Trail?\nAlong with American and Mexican\ntraders, there were many others\nwho traveled the trail: Indians, fur\ntrappers, buffalo hunters,\nadventurers, scouts such as Kit\nCarson, soldiers protecting the\ncaravans or supplying the forts that\nwere built along the trail, journalists\nand what Josiah Gregg, author of a\nchronicle of the trail, called, the\n\"amateur tourist and the listless\nloafer.\u201d Even invalids, hoping that\nhardship and fresh air would\nrestore them to health, set out on\nthe monumental trek. Very few\nwomen made the journey.\n\nFew written accounts survive of the\nexperiences of Hispanic traders\nfrom this period, but from the start,\nMexicans and Hispanics traveled\neast taking silver, mules, buffalo\nhides, and beaver furs (called \"soft\ngold\") to waiting markets in\nMissouri. By the end of the trail era,\nHispanic travelers comprised up to\n90% of the trail traffic.\n\nSusan Shelby Magoffin\nA young, jut-married nineteen-year-old from\nKentucky, she accompanied her trader\nhusband from Missouri to Santa Fe and south\ninto Mexico in 1846. She chronicled the\njourney in Down the Santa Fe Trail and into\nMexico in 1847.

His health restored, Josiah Gregg\nultimately made the trip eight times and became a\nSanta Fe trader engaging in trade between the\nUnited States and Mexico.

The United States and the\nSoviet Union faced each other with bristling arrays of weapons. While all-out nuclear war between the two superpowers was unlikely, the possibility of a shooting war in\nEurope breaking out was never far from the minds of American military planners, with\ntheir still-fresh memories of World War II and the Berlin Blockade.\n\nNations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) feared a surprise Soviet\nattack on Western Europe. The need for an effective defense against such an attack was\nclear. There was also a need for an air-defense capability for potential \"brushfire\"\nconflicts, and for defending American cities against the Soviet bombers that constituted a major strategic threat.\n\nThus, in 1952, the U.S. Army began design studies for a medium-range surface-to-air missile system. In July 1954, the Army awarded contracts to Raytheon Corporation\nfor the missile and to Northrop Corporation for the launcher, radar and fire-control system. The missile was called HAWK. It was not an acronym at first-only later did it become a \"backronym\u201d meaning \"Homing All-the-Way Killer\u201d or, according to some sources, \"Homing All-Weather Killer.\"\nThe first HAWK test flight took place at nearby White Sands Missile Range (WSMR)\nin August 1955. Testing ramped up for several years, with 21 missiles fired at WSMR\nin 1956, 27 in 1957, 48 in 1958 and a peak of 83 in 1959. The system entered service with the Army in August 1959, and with the U.S. Marine Corps in 1960. During its 50-year-plus lifetime, HAWK was used by more than two dozen nations (some continue to use it today) and was produced under license in Europe and Japan. Over the years, frequent\nupgrades and improvements gave HAWK enhanced capabilities to destroy low-altitude, high-speed aircraft, cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles (TBMS).\n\nHAWK is powered by an Aerojet General M22E8 solid-propellant rocket motor, with\nhigh thrust for launch and lower thrust for sustained flight. The missile finds its target using an X-band radar seeker. The three radar units displayed here are the keys to the HAWK system. The AN/MPQ-35 C-band PAR (Pulse Acquisition Radar), with its distinctive curved mesh antenna, detects high-and medium-altitude aerial threats. The\nrectangular-antenna AN/MPQ-34 CWAR (Continuous Wave Acquisition Radar) detects low-altitude threats. The dual-dish AN/MPQ-33 HPI (High-Power illumination) tracks and illuminates the targets with radar energy, which the missile seeker detects and\nhomes in on. This technique is called \"semi-active homing.\u201d The missile itself does not transmit radar energy. It simply detects radar pulses from a ground unit that are reflected off the target in the direction of the missile.\n\nHAWK carries a 120-pound high-explosive blast-fragmentation warhead with both impact and proximity fuzes. In 1956, the Army considered using a sub-kiloton-yield W42\nnuclear warhead on HAWK, but cancelled that effort at the end of 1960. HAWKS are\ncarried on and launched from M192 triple-missile towed launchers.\n\nIncluding foreign production, more than 40,000 HAWK missiles of all versions were\nbuilt. The U.S. Army deployed the system in Viet Nam and in the Persian Gulf, but American troops have never fired it in combat. HAWK's combat debut was in 1967, when\nIsrael used it to destroy several Egyptian fighters in the Six-Day War. HAWKs also\nsaw action in the Persian Gulf (although not by American troops) when Kuwaiti air defense units brought down 22 Iraqi aircraft and one helicopter during the invasion of\nthat nation on August 2, 1990.\n\nWar Eagles Air Museum obtained this HAWK equipment from the German Air Force Command at Fort Bliss, Texas.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 556168, "filename": "556168.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Doda", "taken": "December 26, 2018", "submitted": "December 10, 2020, by Craig Doda of Napoleon, Ohio.", "caption": "MIM-23 Surface-to-Air Missile System Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2576, "height": 1932, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 556169, "filename": "556169.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Doda", "taken": "December 26, 2018", "submitted": "December 10, 2020, by Craig Doda of Napoleon, Ohio.", "caption": "MIM-23 Surface-to-Air Missile System Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2576, "height": 1932, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.70035, 31.87551]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 163186, "number": null, "title": "Matilda Coxe Stevenson (1849-1915)", "subtitle": "New Mexico Historic Women Marker Initiative", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "State of New Mexico", "address": null, "city": "Ramah", "subcity": null, "county": "Cibola County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on Ice Caves Road (New Mexico Route 53 at milepost 42.2), \u00be mile east of Indian Service Route 125, on the right when traveling east.

These earliest national monuments continue to delight us more than one hundred years later.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 558967, "filename": "558967.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 20, 2016", "submitted": "December 23, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Visitors Through the Ages Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4255, "height": 2741, "aspect": 1.55235315578256}, {"photo_id": 558970, "filename": "558970.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 20, 2016", "submitted": "December 23, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Visitors Through the Ages Marker", "subcaption": "(El Morro in background)", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4896, "height": 3496, "aspect": 1.40045766590389}, {"photo_id": 559084, "filename": "559084.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 20, 2016", "submitted": "December 24, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "One of Many Spanish Expedition-era El Morro Inscriptions", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2372, "height": 1332, "aspect": 1.78078078078078}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-108.34262, 35.03746]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 163200, "number": null, "title": "Monumental Changes", "subtitle": "El Morro National Monument", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "National Parks Service, U.S. Department of the Interior", "address": null, "city": "Ramah", "subcity": null, "county": "Cibola County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from El Morro National Monument Road, 0.9 miles Ice Caves Road (State Highway 53).

The duty station was remote, the dirt roads leading in and out were often impassible during wet weather, and a lack of running water or electricity made living conditions primitive. In fact, the first ranger cabin, which also served as a tourist shelter, began as nothing more than a three-sided shed.The advent of the public works programs of the Depression Era changed the face of El Morro National Monument. A new custodian's residence and visitor contact station were completed in 1939, utilizing Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds \u2014 one of the New Deal programs initiated by President Roosevelt. The superintendent and his family finally enjoyed the luxuries of running water and a coal furnace. The sandstone residence before you now serves as the administrative offices for El Morro.Mission 66With the post-World War II economy booming and an increasingly mobile public, it wasn't long before El Morro didn't seem quite as far off the beaten path. As visitation rose each year, El Morro soon outgrew its small visitor contact station.El Morro wasn't alone. In 1956, the National Park Service (NPS) initiated Mission 66 \u2014 a ten-year program created to revitalize the national parks in time for the 50th anniversary of the NPS in 1966.The visitor center through which you entered was completed in 1964 as part of the Mission 66 effort. Its modern architecture is typical of the many other NPS visitor centers built during this time. It is, along with the 1939 residence, as much a part of El Morro's history as the inscriptions themselves.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 558986, "filename": "558986.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "May 20, 2016", "submitted": "December 23, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Monumental Changes Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4323, "height": 2848, "aspect": 1.51790730337079}, {"photo_id": 559081, "filename": "559081.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 24, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "It was very rough.

Instead, it rushed downhill, gathering in arroyos in fast-moving torrents.Huge amounts of wood were harvested from nearby hills to heat homes and power steam engines for the mines.A Community EffortSince the flood era, private and government efforts have focused on turning a destructive process into a restorative one. Vegetation has returned to the hills, soil erosion is under control, and flow from underground springs has become reliable. Because rainfall is better absorbed to recharge our groundwater, Silver City's municipal water supplies are more productive and dependable, too.Today, the Big Ditch is a much-valued urban park.

The small cottage sported a hole in its roof to admit sunlight \u2014 quite an advanced concept in 1883!Finding herself widowed in 1885 with three children, Elizabeth rose to the occasion and took over her husband's insurance business. Later she would expand into real estate, acquiring and managing many properties. Elizabeth's business did well, but she also used her influence and resources for the benefit of the town.

Wilderness, to Leopold, was an area still wild enough and big enough to travel on horseback for two weeks without crossing any roads or seeing other signs of human development. He found that the Gila Forest was big enough and still wild enough to do this. In 1924, he persuaded the Forest Service to set aside 755,000 acres of the Gila so people in the future could have this experience as well. This became our country's first designated wilderness.\nWilderness areas are, first of all, a series of sanctuaries for the primitive arts of wilderness travel... I suppose some will wish to debate whether it is important to keep these primitive arts alive. I shall not debate it. Either you know it in your bones, or you are very, very old. \u2014 A. Leopold\nMan always kills the thing he loves, and so we the pioneers have killed our wilderness. Some say we had to. Be that as it may, I am glad I shall never be young without wild country to be young in. Of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map? \u2014 A. Leopold\nThe Wilderness Act of 1964 describes wilderness as a place where the land is affected primarily by the forces of nature, a place where humans are only visitors. To go into the wilderness, you will need to walk or ride on a horse or mule, just as people have always done. Wilderness gives you a way to step back in time, to experience the solitude and majesty of the natural world.\nCaptions\nLeft: Aldo Leopold worked for the Forest Service in Arizona and New Mexico between 1909 and 1924.\nRight: Aldo Leopold was also a noted philosopher, writer and teacher.

The idea of preserving Wilderness was developed by Aldo Leopold when he was a Forest Ranger on the Gila National Forest back in the 1920's. Like Theodore Roosevelt before him, he thought that the encroachment of human development into wild landscapes was a detriment to the health and well-being for all living creatures. People need wild areas as much as plants and animals. A place to challenge their physical and mental abilities, awaken their soul and connect spiritually.In 1964 the Wilderness Act was passed to designate wild areas and exclude development of unmodified landscapes. With the implicit intent to preserve primitive environments as a whole so they can serve as both retreat and reserve, providing both solitude and tranquility now and into the future.\n\nWilderness con W mayuscula identifica un paisaje muy especial reservado por el Congreso para conservar su estado salvaje sin humanos, reteniendo sus caracteristicas e infuencia original.

De igual forma que Theodore Roosevelt, el pensaba que la invasion de desarollos humanos en los paisajes naturales era un detrimento de la salud y el bienestar de todas las criaturas viventes. Los seres humanos necistiamos areas salvajes tanto como las plantas y animalas. Un lugar para retar sus habilidades fisicas y mentales, despertar su alma y conectarse espiritualmente.\nEn 1964 el Wilderness Act fue aprobado para designar y excluir la urbanizacion de areas salvajes inalteradas. Con la explicita intencion de preserver los ambientes salvajes para que puedan servir tanto como un lugar de retiro, como una reserva natural, proveyendo soledad y\ntranquilidad ahora y en el futuro.\n\nKeep Wilderness Wild\nTo keep Wilderness Wild it takes all of us working together to preserve the primitive environment.

Although vulnerable to MiG-15 jet fighter attacks, the Superfortress remained effective against several types of targets throughout the Korean War.Advanced Technology\nThe B-29 was, at the time of its introduction, the most advanced bomber aircraft in the world. It featured pressurization with heating and air conditioning and a radically new and efficient wing.

The unit has also flown the P-51, F-80, F-100 and A-7 fighter aircraft. The Tacos deployed and have flown combat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia and Iraq and were mobilized and flew combat air patrol sorties throughout the United States following the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.\nF-16 Fighting Falcon - \"Viper\"\nThe F-16 evolved from a 1972 USAF Lightweight Fighter (LWF) prototype program, which sought a small, lightweight, low cost, air superiority day fighter designed for high performance and ease of maintenance. The General Dynamics YF-16 was selected the winner, over the Northrop YF-17, after the LWF fly-off competition was completed. The F-16 achieved combat-ready status in October 1980.\nTechnical Notes (Based upon Block 40 F-16):\nArmament: One 20mm M61A1 Vulcan cannon and various combinations of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and bombs\nEngine: One General Electric F-110-GE-100 turbofan with 28,000 maximum thrust in afterburner\nMaximum speed: 1,353 mph, Mach 2.05\nCruising speed: 575 MPHRange: 1,407 miles\nService ceiling: 50,000 ft.\nSpan: 33 ft. 1 in with AIM-120 missiles mounted\nLength: 49 ft. 5 in.

The A-7 was designed to carry almost any conventional weapon in the Navy inventory. It was also capable of carrying nuclear weapons such as the Walleye, Mk-28, B-61 and B-83. The aircraft also carried a 20mm Mk 12 cannon.\nThe aircraft was given the name Corsair II in honor of the famous Vought F-4U Corsair fighter of WWII and Korea. Aviators and crews gave it the unofficial nickname \"SLUF\" (Short Little Ugly Feller.) The A-7 saw extensive use during the Vietnam War.\nThe A-7 was built in many versions, including a United States Air Force version. By the end of production in 1984, a total of 1,564 A-7s were built. The Navy and Air Force retired the aircraft in 1991. The Air National Guard flew the A-7 until 1993. The last A-7 was taken out of service when the Greek Air Force retired their last A-7 in 2014.

The test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto\ndesert about 35 miles (56 km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was\nthen the USAAF Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range.\nThe only structures originally in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and\nIts ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a \"clean room\" for assembling the\nbomb components. A base camp was constructed and there were 425 people\npresent the test.\nThe code name \"Trinity\" was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer, for the director\nof the Los Alamos Laboratory, inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The test was\nof an implosion-design plutonium device, informally nicknamed \"The Gadget\", of\nthe same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on\nAugust 9, 1945.\nThe complexity of the design required a major effort from the Los Alamos\nLaboratory and concerns about whether it would work led to a decision to conduct\nthe first nuclear test. The test was planned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge.\nThe Uranium bomb Little Boy was a simpler design and did not require a test.\nWhat was at stake?\nAt stake was an invasion of Japan and with it the lives of thousands of American\nand Allied troops and millions of Japanese lives. Thousands of American troops\nwere already redeploying from Europe to the Pacific. The Soviet Union (America's\nwartime ally) was contemplating an invasion of Northern Japan. President Truman\nwanted to end the war as soon as possible, with the least amount of casualties.\nAfter the horrific battle for Okinawa, the President did not want an even more\nhorrific invasion of Japan.\nFat Man Deployment\nThe Fat Man plutonium core and its initiator left Kirtland Field for Tinian Island on July 26, 1945 in a C-54 transport plane. It arrived on Tinian on July 28. Also on July 28, three specially-modified B-29s flew from Kirtland Field carrying three Fat Man\nbomb assemblies each encased in an outer ballistic shell. They arrived at Tinian on August 2, 1945.\n320th Troop Carrier Squadron (320th TCS)\nThe 320th Troop Carrier Squadron was assigned to the 509th Composite Group.

Of the first thirteen B-52s delivered to the United States Air Force, ten were B models.\nThe B model was outwardly identical to the A model, but had an increased reconnaissance capability. The B model also had the improved MA-6A bombing navigation system. Fifty B-52Bs were produced before production began of the B-52C.\nThe B-52B on exhibit was accepted by Major Jerome L. Blanchard on April 29, 1955 at the Boeing Plant in Seattle, Washington. Major Blanchard then flew it to Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. This aircraft was assigned to the Special Weapons Center at Kirkland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, NM. It participated in several nuclear test series. In May 1956, during Operation Redwing Cherokee, it was the first B-52 to drop a hydrogen bomb. In 1962, it participated in Operation Dominic, which were the last atmospheric tests conducted by the United States.\nGeneral Specifications: B-52B\nArmament: Two 20mm cannons or four 50 caliber machine guns, 43,000 lbs. of bombs\nEngines: Eight Pratt & Whitney J57-P-1W\nMaximum Speed: 630\nmph. at 20,000 ft.\nCruising Speed: 525 mph.\nRange: 3590 miles at combat weight. 7, 350 miles maximum ferry range\nService Ceiling: 47,000 ft. at combat weight\nSpan: 185 ft.\nLength: 156 ft. 7 in.\nWeights: Empty 164,081 lbs; combat 293,100 lbs; maximum take-off 420,000 lbs\nCrew: Six to eight depending on mission\nSource: United States Air Force\nThis aircraft is on loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 608735, "filename": "608735.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

Typically a Hound Dog would be launched at 45,000 feet, climb to over 56,000 feet, cruise to the target area, and then dive to the\ntarget. The missile's range of more than 600 miles allowed long-distance \"stand-off\" launching, which reduced the risk to the B-52. The Hound Dog entered service with the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in December 1959.\nThe AGM-28B Hound Dog, an advanced version of the A, first flew in May 1961. It incorporated an improved guidance system and had greater range. Almost 700 AGM-28s were built before production ended in 1963.

Peacekeepers became operational in 1986.Constructed with an airframe made of a Kevlar epoxy composite, the Peacekeeper was much lighter than previous ICBM, and it could carry more warheads. When combined with new Multiple Independently Targeted Re-entry Vehicles (MRV) technology, one Peacekeeper could accurately deliver a number of nuclear warheads on different targets at the same time. A four-stage missile Peacekeeper was the first Air Force ICBM to use the \"cold launch\" technique similar to the system used to launch missiles from submarines.\nThe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) II, signed in 1993 with Russia, removed all multiple-warhead ICBMs. As a result of the changed strategic world situation and START II, the United States deactivated all 50 LGM-118As between 2003 and 2005.

Its development began in 1956 as a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy project.Originally designed for shipboard use, Jupiter was a compromise between Army and Navy designs. In 1956, the Department of Defense gave the\nU.S. Air Force responsibility for building and operating all missiles with more than a 200-mile range. The Jupiter instantly became an U.S. Air Force program.\nJupiter was a single-stage liquid-fueled missile using internal guidance system. It was the first mobile strategic ballistic missile to use ablative heat shield on the nosecone section. Such shields would be used on the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecraft. Some modified versions of the Jupiter were used as first-stage boosters for early U.S. satellite launches. The Jupiter is perhaps best known as a bargaining chip in the resolution of the 1963 Cuban\nMissile Crisis.\nTechnical notes\nEngine: One Rocketdyne S-3D of 150,000 lbs. thrust\nGuidance: All-inertial\nLength: 60 ft.\nDiameter: 8 ft. 9 in\nWeight: 108,804 lbs.

The Thor Missile was designed to be an interim nuclear deterrent while the United States Air Force (USAF) developed long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) as a top national priority. The IRBM concept called for a missile with a range of about 1,500 miles that would be based in Europe. Three companies, Douglas Aircraft Company, Lockheed Corporation and North American Aviation submitted bids for the contract to build the Thor\nmissile. On December 27, 1955 the Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the prime contract.\nBritish Involvement\nThe British Government was approached with the idea of basing Thor missiles in Britain as Royal Air Force (RAF) missiles. The U.S. would provide the missiles, spare parts and training. The British would provide the bases, infrastructure and personnel. A formal agreement was reached in June 1958. Sixty missiles were deployed to 20 RAF stations. Each missile was designed to fit into the USAF, C-124 Globemaster Il transport aircraft for delivery to Britain.\nService History\nThe Thor on exhibit was manufactured at the Douglas Aircraft Company plant in Santa Monica, California in 1958. Later that same year it was shipped to Britain as\none of the 60 missiles assigned to the RAF. In 1963 it was returned to the Douglas Santa Monica plant and was refurbished. It spent the rest of its service in\nvarious testing programs. On March 15, 1994 it was transferred to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History.\nTermination\nUnder the agreement with Britain, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After this, funding would fall on Britain, which would have to take over their logistic support. With new ICBMs becoming available, there was no reason to continue the Thor program. On May 1, 1962, the United States announced that it would not provide support for Thor after October 31, 1964. At about the same time the British announced that they were ending the program. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on August 23, 1963.\nTechnical Notes:\nEngines: One Rocketdyne LR79-NA-9 of 150,000lbs. thrust; two Rocketdyne LR101-NA vernier engines (for small thrust and direction adjustments) of 1,000 lbs. thrust each\nGuidance: All-inertial\nLength: 65 ft.\nDiameter: 8 ft.\nWeight: 110,000 lbs.

When the\nSpaniards first arrived in 1540 they largely ignored the Indians and\ntheir turquoise. They were much more interested in excavating the\narea's large deposits of the valuable minerals of silver and gold.\nIn the mid-1600's, Spanish conquerors, looking for more silver and gold,\nforced the local natives to work in the mines until the Pueblo Revolt of\n1680. Thirteen years later, in 1693, the Spanish Crown reconquered\nthe area establishing farms and ranches in and around the Madrid area.\nBy 1892 the yield from a narrow valley known as \u201cCoal Gulch\u201d was so large, a 6.5 mile spur from the Santa Fe Railroad was routed into the Madrid canyon to transport the coal.Madrid mines provided coal to the country through the great depression and through both world wars.\nMadrid is famous for its Christmas lightsWalt Disney was so impressed by the spectacular Christmas displays in Madrid, it is said he modeled the idea for Disneyland\u2019s Main Street after this small town. Pan American Airlines would reroute air traffic over Madrid at Christmas.\nMadrid (MAD-rid) \u201ccomes of age\u201d\u2026\nAt its coal mining peak over 3,000 people lived and worked in Madrid, exceeding the opulation of Albuquerque during that same period. This \u201ccompany town\u201d provided its residents with most all of their basic needs, including housing, schools, a fully equipped hospital and a company store. As much as 16,000 gallons of water was brought in daily in railroad tank cars. Many local residents still carry in clean drinking water.\nMadrid 1900Coal mining puts Madrid on the map The rich coal mines upon which Madrid sat, cover some 30 square miles and are connected by a network of tunnels that made up the Lucas & White Ash, the Peacock, and the Cooke mines.\nCoal production peaked in 1928, when over 180,000 tons were shipped out of Madrid on\ncoal cars. The town of Madrid collapsed along with the coal market in 1954. Under the management of the mine boss Oscar Huber, Madrid residents enjoyed paved streets, a hospital, a company store, a cafeteria, schools and unlimited electricity in their homes, from a company owned power plant. During prohibition, the company even furnished a place where people could distill illegal liquor. Oscar Huber formed the Employee's Club and arranged regular athletic activities and town parades and events. Miners were required to donate $.50 a month for community causes.\nOld Engine #769 on display in the Old Coal Museum, still sits where it ended its last historic journey.** Visit our historic Coal Mine Museum\nAfter the coal market decline, almost all of its residents moved away and Madrid became a ghost town. We even have our very own ghosts, that are still said to haunt the Mine Shaft Tavern today.Believe it or not!\u2026 by the early 1970's a number of artists, craftsmen, and other individuals wanting to make their homes in the mountains started moving in and renovating the town. Madrid was reborn as the Artist Community it is today. \u201cLight it and they will play\u201dFirst lit baseball field west of the MississippiCoal miners in Madrid form the first baseball team in 1920Baseball became a vital force in Madrid and the focus of everyday life through the depression and through both World Wars.

But in the end it was the railroad that made the town.It is hard to imagine how tough travel and trade were before the railroad. A trip from Santa Fe to Cerrillos often took an entire day, and long-distance travel was a major undertaking. The railroad cracked economic opportunity wide open, and the best opportunities were in places where the tracks would be laid.\nIn 1871 Steven B. Elkins purchased 606 acres of US Government land along the\nGalisteo River where he planned, once the tracks had arrived, \u201ca town to serve the coal\nand hard rock mining areas.\" He paid $2.50 per acre, about $27,000 in today's money.\nThat expectation gave rise, starting January 1879, to the hard rock mining boom in the\nCerrillos Hills. The first tracks reached Cerrillos Station on February 15, 1880.\nMarch 8 was designated as Founder's Day.\nIn the small hours of the morning of June 23, 1890 the cry of \"Fire!\" rang out and\nevery building on this block was destroyed.In 1901 the first electricity came to\nCerrillos, supplied by the Cochiti Gold Mining Co.'s new electric plant in Madrid.\n1905 saw the first telephone connection with Santa Fe. But the railroad was now\nbuilt and except for track maintenance and Madrid there weren't as many jobs\naround. Cerrillos Station was changing, slowing down.\nHow slow? On February 10, 1904, after fewer than 14 years as an\nincorporated town, the male voters of Cerrillos who had paid their poll tax\nvoted 23 to 8 to disincorporate.Once boisterous Cerrillos withered to a\nsleepy little village on State Route 10 (later called SR-14, the Turquoise Trail), and the\nlocal economy was sustained by the railroad and local mining, mostly coal. In 1892 Madrid had become a company coal town and it continued as such for the next 40 years.\nThe Depression of 1930-1941 was unkind to Cerrillos and Madrid, and WWII even more so. Sometimes mistaken for ghost towns, Cerrillos and Madrid, especially Madrid,\nslowly evolved.Cerrillos remains a quiet bedroom community, but\nMadrid's second life is that of a hippie artist town. Cerrillos residents don\u2019t want the streets paved or their sleeping dogs disturbed. They enjoy their quiet village off the highway. Old buildings like the What Not Shop, the Simoni Store, and Mary\u2019s Bar dominate the town.Today Cerrillos\u2019 quiet charm, and Madrid\u2019s eclectic esthetic make them must-sees for travelers on the Turquoise Trail. And more people from other places are moving in. Waldo Mesa, Goldmine Road, the Little Garden of the Gods, and San Marcos are all parts of Greater Cerrillos.Captions:\nCerrillos 1904, looking southeast. Across the Galisteo River Otro Lado is beginning to be well-populated. The two-storey building in Otro Lado is the new school house, opened in 1892. This year marks the Mary Mining & Smelting Co.'s (left center) last year of operation. The large building above the new San Marcos Arroyo bridge is the Palace Hotel.\nSunday at the new Iglesia de San Jos\u00e9/St. Joseph\u2019s Church, which was built in 1922 to replace the smaller adobe church next door that dated from 1884. Fray Angelico Ch\u00e1vez served as pastor of St. Joseph's from 1962 to 1964.\nAbove: The South Railroad Street frontage (north side of Block 9), as it appeared just before the fire of June 23 destroyed the entire block.Right: Albert C. Teichmann\u2019s store was established three years after the fire.The Palace Hotel, the southwest corner of Third Street & Main Street. The famous Tiffany Saloon & 'Mellerdrama\u2019 Theatre, southwest corner of First and Main Streets, was owned and operated by Fran Eckols and Nadine Helden. Opened in 1962, it achieved a national reputation for its food and convivial atmosphere. While under sublease in 1977 it was destroyed by fire.The association with Tiffany, the New York jeweler, comes from an earlier (1907) owner of these lots, James P. McNulty, who was the superintendent of the famous Tiffany turquoise mines six miles north of Cerrillos.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 610312, "filename": "610312.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

Their leader and first governor, Don Juan de O\u00f1ate, led\nthis intrepid band north over hundreds of desolate, dangerous miles to the green valleys\nof northern New Mexico. It was there the colonists established themselves by introducing European crops and the first horses, sheep, goats, cattle, donkeys and poultry \u2013 thereby establishing European culture and technology in the United States, where they had not previously existed.With the settlers came the Franciscan priests and brothers who ministered to the colonists and to the native inhabitants of the region. It was this unswerving devotion to their faith and to their families that consoled and inspired those settlers and their\ndescendants to endure and prevail over 400 years of isolation, abandonment, hardship and cultural challenges. It is to those heroic precursors that our community joins in raising this monument to our forefathers continuing contributions to the history, culture and values of today's America.

In 1916 it was modified into the prevailing\nSpanish-Pueblo Indian architectural style. At this time many\nof the 19th century buildings on the Plaza and in\ndowntown Santa Fe underwent similar conversions.\nA virtually intact 1870s period military officer's quarters exists beneath this facade. Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett, founder of the Museum\nof New Mexico and advocate of the\nSpanish-Pueblo style, lived here for\nthirty years. This building is listed on\nthe New Mexico Register of Cultural\nProperties and the National Register\nof Historic Places.Caption: Hewett House (left) as it appeared ca. 1885", "photos": [{"photo_id": 610849, "filename": "610849.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

Petry distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk\nof his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya\nProvince, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd\nBattalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house\nthat potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant\nPetry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy\nfighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed only a few teet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard tor his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the waist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon\nhimself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 610873, "filename": "610873.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

The monument was\nestablished in 1990 to protect the petroglyphs and related archeological sites on\nAlbuquerque's West Mesa. It is cooperatively managed by the City of Albuquerque\nOpen Space Division and the National Park Service.\nSurveys confirm the presence of more than 24,000 petroglyphs along the volcanic\nescarpment. Petroglyphs are a valuable record of cultural expression and hold\nprofound spiritual significance for certain contemporary American Indian tribes\nand for heirs of local Spanish land grants. While there are many similarities\nbetween images found on kiva murals and painted pottery, the original meaning\nof each petroglyph is known only by its creator. Whether or not their\ninterpretations are known or their purpose understood in the 21st century, all\npetroglyphs preserve the beliefs and virtues of their makers. The petroglyphs\nhere are a vital part of the heritage of the American Indian people who continue\nto live in the region-equally so, they are part of our national story and heritage.\n\nCommon Petroglyph Meanings\nMacaw parrots represent the complexity and development of Pueblo culture through trade and communication of ideas with the MesoAmerican cultures.Spiral petroglyph and pictograph images are commonly found throughout the Southwest and are associated with wind, water, spiritual emergence, and an individual\u2019s journey through life.Geometric and abstract images such as this, and also circles and squares are commonly found along the escarpment. These symbols can be associated with nomadic desert cultures that likely created the oldest petroglyphs in the monument 2000 to 3000 years ago.Hands were the most useful tools for early cultures and handprints were used to mark territory, sacred places, and were also the emblem left behind by medicine men.Captions:Native animals were an important part of the Pueblo culture. Various desert animals are depicted in petroglyph and pictograph form throughout the Southwest. Animal imagery can represent family clan affiliations within the Pueblo social organization or may simply communicate a food resource.Macaw petroglyphs verify the extensive trade network that existed among North American, Central American and South American native people. Colorful macaw feathers were used to adorn ceremonial clothing worn during community celebrations.Welcome to Petroglyph National MonumentVisitor information not transcribedOver 50 Park Units Within a Day\u2019s Drive!Additional park information not transcribed", "photos": [{"photo_id": 612662, "filename": "612662.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

", "missing": null, "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=182820", "description": "Petroglyph National MonumentWhat type of rock is this?The rock that makes up the West Mesa escarpment is vesicular basalt. The basalt flow originated from fissures marked by five volcanic spatter cones that be seen along the western horizon of Albuquerque. Located within the monument boundary, these cones are considered part of a sacred landscape by many of the Pueblo people today. The last volcanic eruption occurred approximately 150,000 years ago. Although the area is still geologically active, geologists consider these spatter cones to be dormant.The basalt that makes up the boulders on which the petroglyphs are carved was originally a light gray color. Over time the surface of the rock was coated by a thin black or dark brown layer of oxidation scientists call desert varnish. When the surface of the boulder is pecked or abraded, the lighter gray rock underneath is exposed, making two-tone petroglyph images possible.\nWhat are Petroglyphs?Petroglyphs are images carved, pecked or incised directly into rock surfaces using a stone chisel and hammerstone. Petroglyphs differ from pictographs, which are paintings on rock. When the \u201cdesert varnish\u201d on the surface of the rock was was pecked or scratched off, the lighter rock underneath was exposed, creating a two-tone petroglyph. Archeological surveys have found over 21,000 petroglyph images along the 17 miles of escarpment within the monument\u2019s boundary.It is estimated that 90% of the monument\u2019s petroglyphs were created by the ancestors of today\u2019s Pueblo people. The Rio Grande valley has been home to many of the Pueblo people since before 500 A.D., but a drought in the late 13th century caused many new settlements along the Rio Grande. It is believed that the majority of the petroglyphs were carved between 1300 and 1700 A.D. A small percentage of the petroglyphs found within the monument pre-date the Puebloan time period, perhaps reaching as far back as 3,000 years ago. Other images date from historic periods, starting in the 1700\u2019s with petroglyphs carved by early Spanish settlers.\nPueblo: People or Place?Perhaps no other word in the Southwest carries so much weight and meaning, used to describe buildings, people, language, culture and time. But the literal translation of \u201cpueblo\u201d from the Spanish language is far more simple, it means village or city.When Spanish explorers traveled up the Rio Grande in 1540 A.D., they met Native Americans who were not nomadic, but were farmers who lived in independent communities, each with their own tribal elders, culture and language. The Spanish named these people and the above ground dwellings the people lived in Pueblos. Today there are 19 remaining Pueblos in New Mexico.Often times terms like Pueblo people, Puebloan and Pueblos refer to the 19 remaining groups as a whole. It is important to remember that each one of these groups is separate, with its own culture and traditions. The term pueblo can also refer to the historic physical structures that these people live in, or can refer to their government or the land set aside as an independent nation.Why not Anasazi?The term Anasazi has been in standard use by both scholars and the public for many years. Anasazi is a term derived from two Navajo words meaning \u201cenemy ancestor\u201d or \u201cancient enemy.\u201d To many modern Pueblo tribes the word is culturally insensitive and inappropriate to use when referring to their ancestors. Today the Pueblo people prefer the term Ancestral Puebloan when referring to their ancestors.\nWhy were Petroglyphs made?There were many reasons for creating the petroglyphs, many of which are not well understood by persons outside of Native American culture. Petroglyphs are more than just \u201crock art,\u201d picture writing, or an imitation of the natural world. They should not be confused with hieroglyphics, which are symbols used to represent words, and should not be thought of as ancient Indian graffiti. Petroglyphs are powerful cultural symbols that reflect the complex societies and religions of the surrounding tribes.Petroglyphs are central to the monument\u2019s sacred landscape where traditional ceremonies still take place. The context of each image is extremely important and integral to its meaning. Note each petroglyph\u2019s orientation to the horizon and surrounding images, as well as the landscape in which it sits. Today\u2019s Pueblo people have stated the placement of each petroglyph image was not a casual or random decision.Some petroglyphs have meanings that are known onl to the individuals who made them. Others represent tribal, clan, kiva or societal symbols. Some are religious entities and others show who came to the area and where they went. Some petroglyphs still have contemporary meaning while the meaning of others is no longer known, but are respected for belonging to those who came before.\nMap of the Petroglyph National Monument panelRinconada CanyonLocated at the intersection of Unser Blvd. and St. Joseph Ave., this 2.5 mile undeveloped round-trip dirt path allows the viewing of hundreds of different petroglyphs along the south facing canyon wall.

", "missing": null, "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=184000", "description": "Business Along Route 66\n\nAs traffic along the road increased, Laguna community members began to sell or trade items at roadside stands within the Pueblo and on adjoining lands to the east and west. Community members built shade structures where they sold their pottery, beadwork, and other crafts and curios to tourists. They also supplied bread, pies, tamales, and seasonal produce. Tribal member Lee Marmon described how women set up cedar branch shelters where they \"would sell property\u2026And then they'd try to sell them [the motorists] bread or corn or things of that sort\" (2009). Cash was not the only way of doing business; barter also occurred. Local people traded with tourists for items uncommon in tribal communities such as non-native jewelry. In addition to trading posts, gas stations, garages, convenience stores, and motels emerged as permanent businesses owned by both tribal members and non-tribal members. \n\nMemories of the Road\n\nDiscussing the history of Route 66 evokes many unique memories for community members at Laguna. Some recollections extend back to the famous highway's initial development, and topics include daily life, special events, national trends, and Indian Policy. Starting in the late 1800s, New Mexican Native American children were forced to attend government-sponsored boarding schools, which were charged with acculturating American Indian youth into mainstream American culture, in addition to their educational mission. Many Native Americans in New Mexico recall travelling by bus on Route 66 to boarding schools.\n\nTraveling to other communities for trade and work was also a memorable part of the Route 66 experience. Laguna community members recalled traveling by horseback, wagon, bus and, in later years, by car to other tribal communities and larger urban centers such as Gallup and Albuquerque - especially after the completion of the Laguna Cut-off in 1937. Although the road facilitated travel, most Laguna residents took trips only when necessary due to the expense. Multiple community members remember traveling with their families to the Pueblos of Santo Domingo, Sandia, Santa Ana, San Felipe, Zia, Jemez, and Isleta to trade. Each Pueblo had its specialties in both art and agriculture. People from Laguna brought their pottery and mutton. They sold or traded squash and pumpkins for alfalfa, wheat, straw, corn, chiles, and fruit. Tribes also traded other important items for use in dances and ceremonies.\n\nLaguna Feast Day occurs annually on September 19 and is one of the largest Pueblo feast-day events in the state. Residents of Laguna recalled that during the Route 66 era, visitors from other communities arrived a few days before the feast day to trade, sell, and socialize. Many Native American families traveled by wagon and set up camp outside the village of Laguna. One community member reported that it was common for several hundred wagons to be camped in the area. Navajos came from Alamo, Canoncito (To'hajiillee), and points west such as Prewitt, Crownpoint, and even Arizona. They brought mutton, weavings, and jewelry. Many Pueblo families came with fresh produce, pottery, jewelry and other handmade wares. The event offered the opportunity to trade various goods with other American Indians and visitors, and to sell to the local trading posts. \n\n(sidebars:)\n\n\nDuring the Dust Bowl times and the Depression, we had a campground out here. There were cabins. The regular cabins used to rent for $1.25 a night, and the deluxe was $1.50 a night. We had a lot of the people from Texas and Oklahoma and back east, Kansas, that were headed west to California, because of the drought. And if you've ever seen that movie, \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" it was exactly like that. And they'd stop here, and some would be completely out of food and money, and they'd have three, four, or five kids, and the dog and the grandma and the grandpa. So what local people would do, they would give 'em enough money to get from here to Grants. When they got to Grants, people in Grants would help 'em, they'd get to Gallup, and on the way 'til they got to California. Things were in pretty bad shape.

They would arrive by wagon trains several days in advance of the feast and camp to the south and east of Old Laguna, along the sand hills. There were sand dunes more prominent than they are today and they would camp at the base of the sand hills there, and come enjoy the feast. - Roland Johnson (2009)", "photos": [{"photo_id": 616932, "filename": "616932.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "October 19, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Trade - Tourism - Economy Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3864, "height": 5152, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 616935, "filename": "616935.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "October 19, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Trade - Tourism - Economy Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is underneath a shelter where the Laguna Burger is", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-107.37385, 35.03738]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184206, "number": null, "title": "Post World War II", "subtitle": "Laguna Pueblo & Route 66", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "New Mexico Department of Transportation, Pueblo of Laguna and the Laguna Development Corporation", "address": "2544 NM-124", "city": "Laguna", "subcity": null, "county": "Cibola County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from the intersection of New Mexico Route 124 and Old Route 66 Road.

After World War II, farming and sheep herding started to decline, although some families continue these agricultural traditions today. Route 66, and later Interstate 40 (I-40), impacted farming and livestock production in several ways. One community service member recounts that in the 1950s his family had to herd their sheep across Route 66 twice a year, to move them to and from summer pastures in the foothills of Mount Taylor. In later years when traffic was heavier, especially after construction of I-40, they had to use the few available underpasses. Farmers also encountered similar problems as the highways divided their fields and limited access to traditional farming areas. Agricultural practices were also affected by the post-World War II increase in local wage-labor jobs, which drew some community members away from family farms and agricultural work.\n\nMining operations that were facilitated or accelerated by highway transportation created some of the greatest socio-economic impacts at Laguna Pueblo. The Jackpile Uranium Mine, located near the village of Paguate about 10 miles north of Route 66, was once the largest open pit uranium mine in North America. The mine employed hundreds of workers, many from Laguna, Acoma, and neighboring communities. The influx of wage-labor jobs provided many families with enough income to purchase automobiles, and vehicle ownership became commonplace in the communities.\n\nInterstate 40 & Laguna\n\nIn the 1960s, the Pueblo of Laguna Council successfully negotiated with the New Mexico State Highway Department (NMSHD, now NMDOT) for re-alignment of I-40 to avoid impacts to tribal communities along its path. The Council denied NMSHD's original right-of-way request for I-40, approximately where NM 124 (Historic Route 66) is today, from the Rio San Jose bridge crossing, passing just north of the village of Old Laguna and heading west through New Laguna, Paraje, and Seama. This proposed route would have cut through these villages, creating physical dangers and disruption to Laguna community life and activities. The Pueblo Council contacted the members of the State's congressional delegation to seek their assistance in communicating issues to NMSHD leadership, compelling them to continue negotiations with Laguna and to accommodate the Pueblo's concerns and request for changes in the proposed alignment. \n\nWhen the Pueblo and NMSHD resumed negotiations, the new alignment was created through a collaborative process. The Pueblo Council designated members to walk with highway department engineers along the entire proposed alignment of I-40 between the villages of Mesita and Seama to coordinate the siting of each interchange. The present-day alignment of I-40 from the Mesita Interchange (exit 117) to the Seama Interchange (exit 104), with all its features and structures, represents the result of this lengthy and successful negotiation process. This experience further demonstrated to Laguna, and other Pueblos, how easily their sovereignty could be undermined by the Pueblo Land Condemnation Act. The Pueblo of Laguna led a New Mexico Pueblo-wide effort to successfully pursue repeal of the Act, thereby requiring the NMSHD and other public agencies to negotiate for rights-of-way, leases, and other land transactions with the Pueblos in the spirit of fairness and consideration of Pueblo requirements, including compensation for land. The Act was repealed in 1976.\n\nInitially, I-40 negatively impacted the small businesses along Route 66. Laguna Pueblo, however, responded by creating new businesses such as convenience centers and casino complexes that addressed the changing needs of motorists. In 2016, Laguna Pueblo owned two casinos and multiple service stations along I-40. Drawing on the historic highway's popular cultural importance, Laguna Pueblo named its flagship enterprise the Route 66 Casino, and several of its convenience centers, 66 Pit Stop. \n\n(sidebar:)\n\nChanging Designs\n\nOver the years, the design of Route 66 changed to meet transportation needs and community goals by incorporating new engineering options. In 2012, the Pueblo of Laguna Council approved a Bike and Transportation Route Master Plan, which prioritized a roundabout at the intersection of NM 124 (Historic Route 66), Old Route 66 Road, and Schoolhouse Road, to allow for safe bicycle, pedestrian, and vehicle travel.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 616929, "filename": "616929.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "October 19, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Post World War II Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3864, "height": 5152, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 616930, "filename": "616930.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "October 19, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Post World War II Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is underneath the sheltered area where Laguna Burger is.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-107.37386, 35.03738]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184208, "number": null, "title": "Continental Divide", "subtitle": "Elevation-7,295 feet", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "New Mexico Historic Preservation Division", "address": "1 NM-122", "city": "Continental Divide", "subcity": null, "county": "McKinley County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on New Mexico Route 122 west of Old U.S. 66, on the right when traveling east.

From Chicago to Los Angeles the \"Main Street of America\" would be U.S. 66. The National Old Trails Highway was on the map. Its route would run right through Gallup, New Mexico in part due to actions of former Gallup Mayor and then NM Governor Arthur T. Hannett. Arthur T. Hannett was born in Lyons, New York, the son of William and Mary McCarthy Hannett. Upon completing high school he entered Syracuse University, where he graduated in 1910. Hannett came to Gallup, New Mexico in 1911, where he began to practice law. His first public office was City Attorney and then served as Mayor of Gallup for four years. \n\nAfter serving as a member of the State Highway Commission from March 1923, until December 1924, Hannett was elected Governor of New Mexico and served from January 1, 1925 until January 1, 1927. \n\nGovernor Hannett lost his pursuit for re-election in 1926 to Richard Dillon. But not until he committed one of his final administrative acts by rerouting U.S. Route 66 to avoid Santa Fe and instead pass through Albuquerque, New Mexico west directly towards Gallup. The rerouting saved drivers traveling across the state nearly four hours. Legend says Hannett did the rerouting to punish the Republican Santa Fe Ring which controlled New Mexico politics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Hannett, in his 1964 book Sagebrush Lawyer, recounts that he conceived of the idea of a shorter route by laying a ruler on the map between Santa Rosa and Gallup.

The Indoor and Outdoor Marketplace and the Ceremonial Showroom present the country's most complete and varied displays of genuine Indian fine arts, including Navajo rugs, kachinas, jewelry, pottery and basketry. There are socials and rodeos held at Red Rock Park and an evening and day parade along Route 66 in downtown Gallup. The evening parade is magical and somewhat eerie because observers often hear the sounds of the dancers long before the performers can be seen. The dancers wear very colorful outfits while observers are dressed in a kaleidoscope of colors representing every possible shade under the rainbow.\n\nIn 1922, Mike Kirk, a local trader with the support of the local Kiwanis Club planned an event that would give the people of Gallup an opportunity to share in Indian culture, their arts and crafts but at the same time show appreciation for the Indian patronage to the Gallup community. Annually, neighboring Indian tribes would travel for days over dusty roads by wagon to arrive at (what they considered) a yearly reunion with family and friends. The early year Ceremonials featured campfire dances, baseball games, a fruit scramble, a tug-of-war, a kick the stick race, and relay marathons. Participants included members of the Navajo and Hopi communities as well as the pueblos of Acoma, Isleta, Laguna, Jemez, Zuni, and Taos.\n\nWhile the four day event still retains some elements of the early days when Natives and non-Native people came to town for entertainment and to socialize, today it has grown into more of a tourist attraction. The exhibit halls are a bright combination of trader/dealer booths and artists representing their own work displaying, the best of the art.\n\nThe Ceremonial dances personify the proud history and tradition of the Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial. It is truly a special time for participants and spectators alike an opportunity for cultures to come together in the universe of rhythm, motion and artistic expression.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 617201, "filename": "617201.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 15, 2021", "submitted": "October 20, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 617250, "filename": "617250.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 15, 2021", "submitted": "October 21, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Inter-Tribal Indian Ceremonial Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is on the left.

Clinton N. Cotton, a shrewd Yankee trader and businessman, concluded that the way to market the wares and crafts of his Navajo trading partners was to develop a wholesale business at \"a point favorably located for transportation.\" So, in 1887 he built the C.N. Cotton Warehouse right along the railroad in Gallup.\n\nClinton N. Cotton was born April 12, 1859 in central Ohio. At the meager age of 11 his father died and C.N. left school for work to support his mother and younger siblings. In 1881 he came west with the railroad working as a telegraph operator at the Fort Wingate station. During his employment with the railroad, Cotton made acquaintance with Juan Lorenzo Hubbell. They soon became friends which led to Cotton purchasing a half interest in the Hubbell Trading Post located at Ganado, Arizona. Together, Cotton and Hubbell were credited with introducing a nationwide mail-ordering system for Navajo goods, especially blankets (rugs). The C.N. Cotton Company became the first and most important wholesale warehouse in Indian country and the first to top a million dollars a year in business.\n\nBy 1894 Cotton sold his half interest in Ganado back to Hubbell in order to focus on his Gallup business. However, he didn't sell before developing a close relationship with Chief Manuelito, a respected Navajo warrior who had signed the treaty with General Sherman in 1868 for all twelve Navajo chiefs. Cotton so respected the chief that the year following Manuelito's death, Cotton commissioned Herman McNeil to make a likeness of him. For nearly a century the sculpture sat high in a niche on the original east fa\u00e7ade of the C.N. Cotton Warehouse. The noble statue greeted traders and travelers from east to west, announcing their arrival to Gallup, New Mexico.\n\nWhile the original building has since been demolished, a newer, larger wholesale warehouse stands in its place. The prestigious statue of Chief Manuelito was donated to McKinley County and is currently on display in the new Courthouse annex overlooking the Courthouse Square in downtown Gallup.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 617202, "filename": "617202.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 15, 2021", "submitted": "October 20, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "CN Cotton Warehouse Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 617203, "filename": "617203.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 15, 2021", "submitted": "October 20, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "CN Cotton Warehouse Marker", "subcaption": "Gallup Amtrak station is in the background", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-108.74077, 35.529]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184302, "number": null, "title": "Balloon Rally", "subtitle": "Scenic Byways Trail", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Federal Highway Administration (America's Byways) and the City of Gallup", "address": "106 U.S. Rte 66", "city": "Gallup", "subcity": null, "county": "McKinley County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on New Mexico Route 118 west of South 1st Street, on the right when traveling west.

In many communities across the United States, historic neon signs line the edges of Route 66, beckoning weary travelers off the highways.\n\nNeon signs have long been a hallmark of roadside commercial advertising. Today even though these signs are prevalent, they are also at risk. Gallup has proudly preserved some of its vintage neon signs with the help of the Route 66 Corridor Act monies and the support of the New Mexico Route 66 Association. The State Historic Preservation Office recognized the value of its neon signs and the need for their preservation. In 2000, former New Mexico State Historic Preservation Officer and Gallup Downtown Development Director, Elmo Baca proposed restoring some of New Mexico's vintage neon. As part of Gallup's downtown renovation project, the roof-mounted Lexington Hotel sign, constructed in 1931 in downtown Gallup, was refurbished.\n\nEach sign is unique to the business. The pink neon outside the El Rancho Hotel, built in 1937 by movie mogul D. W. Griffith's brother, still claims \"Charm of Yesterday, Convenience of Tomorrow.\" Vintage trading posts, hotels and other businesses continue to entice the traveler to stop.

The trail began as a connection from the Missouri frontier in the United States to Santa Fe in Mexico. Spanning 900 miles, the trail also linked to cities deep in Mexico via El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. In its early years, trade stabilized and supported the economies of Missouri and the Mexican province of New Mexico in an era of monetary upheaval in both the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nFrom glory days to romantic memory\n\nPrior to 1821, Spain's colonial policy restricted the kind and number of trade goods available in New Mexico. Trade barriers were lifted after Mexico achieved independence in 1821. Merchants like Antonio Martinez, Juan Jose Delgado, Albert Speyer, and Charles Ilfeld prospered from the trade.\n\nWith the successful American invasion of the Southwest in 1846, the character of the trade changed. Fewer individual traders were involved and more commercial firms began trading. The New Mexico economy was transformed from one of barter to cash. \n\nAfter 1865, the railroad moved westward from Missouri, reaching New Mexico in 1880. The trail was replaced with steam engines and a new era of transportation began.\n(caption:)\nTrader William Becknell made his pioneering trip to Santa Fe in 1821. He returned in 1822 with wagons.

A few months later, the department mandated interment of the dead in graves marked with numbered headboards, recorded in a register.\n\nCreating National Cemeteries\n\nThe authority to create military burial grounds came in an Omnibus Act of July 17, 1862. It directed the president to purchase land to be used as \"a national cemetery for the soldiers who shall die in the service of the country.\u201d Fourteen national cemeteries were established by 1862.\n\nWhen hostilities ended, a grim task began. In October 1865, Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs directed officers to survey lands in the Civil War theater to find Union dead and plan to reinter them in new national cemeteries. Cemetery sites were chosen where troops were concentrated: camps, hospitals, battlefields, railroad hubs. By 1872, 74 national cemeteries and several soldiers' lots contained 305,492 remains, about 45 percent were unknown.\n\nMost cemeteries were less than 10 acres, and layouts varied. In the Act to Establish and to Protect National Cemeteries of February 22, 1867, Congress funded new permanent walls or fences, grave markers, and lodges for cemetery superintendents.\n\nAt first only soldiers and sailors who died during the Civil War were buried in national cemeteries. In 1873, eligibility was expanded to all honorably discharged Union veterans, and Congress appropriated $1 million to mark the graves. Upright marble headstones honor individuals whose names were known; 6-inch-square mark unknowns.\n\nBy 1873, military post cemeteries on the Western frontier joined the national cemetery system. The National Cemeteries Act of 1973 transferred 82 Army cemeteries, including 12 of the original 14, to what is now the National Cemetery Administration.\n\nReflection and Memorialization\n\nThe country reflected upon the Civil War's human toll - 2 percent of the U.S. population died. Memorials honoring war service were built in national cemeteries. Most were donated by regimental units, state governments and veterans' organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic. Decoration Day, later Memorial Day, was a popular patriotic spring event that started in 1868. Visitors placed flowers on graves and monuments, and gathered around rostrums to hear speeches. Construction of Civil War monuments peaked in the 1890s. By 1920, as the number of aging veterans was dwindling, more than 120 monuments had been placed in the national cemeteries.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 618432, "filename": "618432.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 27, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "A National Cemetery System Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 618434, "filename": "618434.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 27, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "A National Cemetery System Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.94957, 35.69621]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184769, "number": null, "title": "In Honor of Those Who Gave the Ultimate Sacrifice", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": "501 N Guadalupe St", "city": "Santa Fe", "subcity": null, "county": "Santa Fe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Memorial can be reached from the intersection of North Guadalupe Street and Alamo Drive.

Pueblo Indians and their ancestors lived here. Between 1600 and 1680, the hill was common land for Santa Fe colonists. The Spanish built a small fort on a hill nearby to house the guardia de prevencion, the city guard. In 1846, early in the Mexican-American War, the hill became a haven for U.S. Army soldiers, who were threatened by local people opposing American occupation.\n\nTurbulent times were seen from this hill above Santa Fe. The election of James K. Polk in 1844 pushed the United States towards a policy of westward expansion. While the U.S. government annexed Texas and looked west at the Mexican provinces of New Mexico and California, Mexico refused to negotiate. Following a skirmish between Mexican troops and an American mounted patrol in a disputed area along the Texas-Mexico border, President Polk declared war on May 13, 1846.\n\nThree Trails to Santa Fe\n\nThe hustle and bustle of trade unfolding on the plaza below could be witnessed from Fort Marcy hill. Before 1821, the 1,600-mile El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (Royal Road of the Interior), from Mexico City to Santa Fe, had served as Santa Fe's only legal trading route and communications link with the outside world.\n\nAfter Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, early traders like William Becknell discovered that there were big profits to be made by bringing trade goods over the 900-mile Santa Fe Trail that stretched between Missouri and Santa Fe. Soon, New Mexico merchants traveled over a third route, the Old Spanish Trail, trading wool for horses and mules in California.\n\nWith travel along three trails, Santa Fe became a major trading hub. Two-way commerce along the trails fostered international business, because merchants now had connections from Mexico to New York, London, and Paris. Ultimately, the Santa Fe Trail also had became a major route for the American invasion of Mexico.\n\n(photo captions:)\n\n\u00b7This 1836 map shows Santa Fe and the Mexican province of New Mexico well beyond the border of the United States.\n\n\u00b7A great deal changed during the following 14 years. In 1845 Texas became part of the United States. New Mexico became an American territory in 1848. By 1850 California was in the U.S. and the present-day U.S.-Mexico border was established.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 618492, "filename": "618492.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 28, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Witnessed from Fort Marcy Hill Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 618500, "filename": "618500.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 28, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Witnessed from Fort Marcy Hill Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.93159, 35.68943]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184792, "number": null, "title": "Invasion of Santa Fe", "subtitle": "Prince Park", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "National Park Service, City of Santa Fe and State Historic Preservation Division", "address": "320 Kearney Ave", "city": "Santa Fe", "subcity": null, "county": "Santa Fe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Kearney Avenue south of Prince Avenue.

They were afraid that the Americans would take away their land, culture, and religion.

An uprising in Taos by New Mexicans and Pueblo Indian men resulted in the death of the appointed governor, Charles Bent.\n\nSymbolism of the Fort\n\nFort Marcy was never intended to be a permanent fortification. If needed, it was a place where troops could retreat, but its larger goal was to serve as a symbol of American military control. From the fort on the hill, all of Santa Fe was within gunshot.\n\nThe American military post and U.S. flag were constant reminders to the New Mexicans of a foreign military presence, but the center of military activity was at the Post of Santa Fe. Located between the fort and the Palace of the Governors, it included the hospital, gardens, storehouses, and headquarters.\n\nAbandonment of the Fort\n\nIn November 1847, the artillery from Fort Marcy was moved to Army buildings closer to the plaza. In 1856, a traveler noted \"the ruins of old Fort Marcy.\"", "photos": [{"photo_id": 618493, "filename": "618493.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 28, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Invasion of Santa Fe Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 618501, "filename": "618501.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 28, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Invasion of Santa Fe Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is the farthest left of the four.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.93161, 35.68945]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184794, "number": null, "title": "First Army Fort in the Southwest", "subtitle": "Prince Park", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "National Park Service, City of Santa Fe and State Historic Preservation Division", "address": "320 Kearney Ave", "city": "Santa Fe", "subcity": null, "county": "Santa Fe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Kearney Avenue south of Prince Avenue.

Commanding officer Brigadier General Stephen Watts Kearny directed Lieutenant William Emory to find the most \"commanding\" site in town for construction of a fort to protect the troops in the event of a local uprising. The fort also reminded New Mexicans of the power of their new American rulers.\n\nThe completed Fort Marcy was never garrisoned by soldiers nor saw the firing of a single shot. By the end of 1847, the guns had been removed and the adobe walls and other features began the slow process of erosion that continues today.\n\nBuilding Fort Marcy\n\nLieutenant J.F. Gilmer, designer of Fort Marcy, first determined the shape of the fort, and then excavated a dry moat around it to shelter troops from enemy fire. Dirt from the moat was used to built nine-foot-high ramparts - earthen embankments topped with adobe walls to shield troops from attack. You can see deep depressions in the ground beyond this exhibit where the moat was located. The long, raised mounds that you can see on this end of the hill are all that remain of the ramparts.\n\nThe fort was built using rammed-earth construction. Troops hauled water up the hill, dampening soil whenever 10 inches were added to the walls. They then walked on top of it to compact each layer. The adobe walls on top contained pieces of broken pottery, bits of worked stone, and corn cobs from the hill's prehistoric occupation. Because there was no milled timber for gun emplacements, Gilmer reported that he intended to place cannons on \"earthen platforms made firm by pounding.\"\n\n(photo captions:)\n\n\u00b7Even though thousands of people passed through Santa Fe in the mid-1800s, there are few photographs, illustration, or other clues about the early years at Fort Marcy. What little we know about its construction comes from U.S. Army reports from officers such as Kearny, soldiers' letters home, and travelers' journal entries.\n\n\u00b7This model shows Fort Marcy as it may have appeared in 1846-47. The main fort and its dry moat was built first, then the platform for gun emplacements, storage magazine for ammunition, and blockhouse. Today you can see the eroded remnants of the fort and blockhouse.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 618496, "filename": "618496.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 28, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "First Army Fort in the Southwest Marker", "subcaption": "Graffiti is on the marker.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 618497, "filename": "618497.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 12, 2021", "submitted": "October 28, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "First Army Fort in the Southwest Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-105.93163, 35.68948]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 184795, "number": null, "title": "The Blockhouse Ruins", "subtitle": "Prince Park", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "National Park Service, City of Santa Fe and State Historic Preservation Division", "address": "320 Kearney Ave", "city": "Santa Fe", "subcity": null, "county": "Santa Fe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Kearney Avenue south of Prince Avenue.

Unlike the fort, blockhouse designer Gilmer ordered that the walls be constructed of sun-dried adobe bricks made in town by local workmen. The timber ceiling was covered with 2 to 3 feet of dirt. The interior walls were finished with white lime plaster.\n\n\"Nothing was left of Fort Marcy. Even the adobe walls had fallen. It was strange to stand there that evening where I had played more than eighty years before. Was it imagination, or did I hear voices? The half-remembered voices of children\u2026or was it the sound of wind sighing down over the mesa?\"\n\nMarion Sloan Russell, 1850s resident of Santa Fe, revisited the city during the 1930s.\n\n\"Fort Marcy had been in ruins many years, but an old two-story building still stood there. Inside the building was another smaller one that was supposed to have been used by sharp shooters during the Mexican War. Erosion was opening many of the graves\u2026\"  Marion Sloan Russell\n\n(photo captions:)\n\n\u00b7By the time this photo was taken in 1912 the old fort walls had become low mounds.\n\n\u00b7Pictured are the ruins of an adobe building. After construction at Fort Marcy ceased in 1847, rain and wind began to wear away the high dirt walls. By the mid-1850s, children had claimed the fort as a playground, where they could conduct pretend battles among the ruins. By the 1880s, world-renowned Southwest archaeologist and Santa Fe resident Adolph F. Bandelier was intrigued with the ruins.

With her family she founded the Stinson Aviation Company, designed aircraft, and operated a flight school. She was the first aviatrix to fly the Orient and set a record in 1917 for the longest West Coast solo flight. \nThe military twice denied her permission to fly in World War I, although she was already flying a U.S. mail carrier. Instead she drove an ambulance for the French Red Cross. Katherine contracted tuberculosis and sought treatment in Santa Fe where she embarked on a new career designing notable Spanish Pueblo Revival-style homes. Her clients included Manhattan Project gatekeeper Dorothy McKibbin. Katherine married airman and future judge, Miguel Otero, Jr., and the couple remained in Santa Fe until their deaths.

This part of the Santa Fe River Greenway follows one of North America's most famous early roads - El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, the Royal Road to the Interior Lands. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mexico and a National Historic Trail in the U.S., the 1,600-mile international route begins in Mexico City and runs north to Santa Fe.\n\nToday's travelers can follow the historic route of El Camino Real on marked roads such as Agua Fria Street or along linked parks and community trails like this one. No matter what route you choose, the fascinating history and natural beauty of the American Southwest await you along every mile. \n\nA Multicultural World\n\nLike today's global economy, international traffic along El Camino Real changed people's lives forever. Food, clothing, languages, religious and spiritual beliefs, architecture, music, art, and ideas about property and society, as well as diseases from Europe, all moved up and down El Camino Real in a continuing multicultural exchange.\n\nFor Sale: Buffalo Hides\n\nPeople have traded on the ancient riverside route of El Camino Real for centuries. Locals traded buffalo hides, pinon nuts, turquoise, and obsidian. Spanish colonists introduced churro sheep, whose wool inspired skilled Pueblo weavers. By 1650, goods traveling El Camino Real might be headed for the next village, Mexico City, or Europe.\n\nHorses and Metal\n\nIn the 1500s, Spanish newcomers advanced up to the Rio Grande on horseback with metal swords and body armor. Horses and metal tools brought profound changes to the region.\n\nMaize Makes the Meal \n\nPueblo people cultivated, ate, and traded maize (corn) long before the Spanish arrived.\n\nThe Santa Fe River Greenway\n\nSanta Fe County and the City of Santa Fe are working in partnership to restore the Santa Fe River to a more natural and healthy state and build a continuous greenway of trails and parks along the river. The Greenway is a retracement hiking trail segment of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail.\n\nThe trail length is one mile and has a continuous paved service with gradual slopes.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church\n\nSpanish explorers and priests introduced their Roman Catholic faith to local villages, with mixed and sometimes violent results. Within 100 years of Spanish contact, most large pueblos had a Spanish mission and priests. Over time, some Ancestral Pueblo people blended their own ancient beliefs with Christianity.\n\nSeeking a Road to Riches\n\nWill the trail ahead improve your health\u2026or your wealth? Many early travelers thought El Camino Real was the path to silver and gold! Others wanted to advance Spanish culture and religion.\n\nSpanish soldiers based in Mexico began exploring the vast interior of North America in the middle 1500s. They sought to claim New World riches for the King of Spain, whose favor could bring great rewards.\n\nOver the past 400 years, travelers along El Camino Real have found not only silver and gold, but a wealth of opportunities in a vast new land.\n\nChocolate and Chile Peppers\n\nAncestral Pueblo people knew about cocoa beans and chile peppers - but Spanish travelers brought new uses of these native New World foods. The results: sweet, hot, cocoa-flavored milk, and meats and vegetables spiced with bright red peppers. Would you like your chocolate milk stirred and warmed in this 1850s-era Mexican copper chocolatera? Delicious!\n\n(photo captions:)\n\n\u00b7A slow-moving wagon train hauls wood to market across the New Mexico desert, circa 1912. Mule-drawn caravans were once a common sight up and down El Camino Real.\n\n\u00b7About 75 miles north of El Paso, El Camino Real veered away from the Rio Grande across 60 miles of almost waterless desert. For unprepared travelers - including Spanish settlers fleeing the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 - the two-day route called the \"Jomada del Muerto\" (Dead Man's Journey) could be a death trap.\n\n\u00b7In 1598 Juan de Onate led 400 settlers from Zacatecas, Mexico northward on El Camino Real to establish Spanish colonies in the interior. This long, rough journey extended the Royal Road by at least 600 miles into present-day New Mexico.\n\n(side quote:)\n\n\"Your main purpose shall be the service of our Lord, the spreading of His Holy Catholic faith\u2026\"\n\n-Contract between Juan de Onate and the Spanish government, 1595", "photos": [{"photo_id": 619408, "filename": "619408.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 2, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3864, "height": 5152, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 619409, "filename": "619409.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 2, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is at the west parking lot of the River Trail.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.06514, 35.63959]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 185096, "number": null, "title": "The Santa Fe Trail", "subtitle": "Santa Fe Trail National Scenic Byway", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "America's Byways", "address": "491 Old Santa Fe Trail", "city": "Santa Fe", "subcity": null, "county": "Santa Fe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Old Santa Fe Trail south of East De Vargas Trail.

It preceded by 20 years the great emigrant trails to the north and, unlike the more northern trails, this trail was an international route of commerce. Pioneered by William Becknell in 1821, the Santa Fe Trail became an important trade route with traffic moving in both directions. When Santa Fe effectively became part of the United States after the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, trade barriers were removed and traffic increased, but the need for the trail ended with the arrival of the railroad in 1880.\nTrail Sites\n\nSanta Fe Plaza\nHere, traders celebrated the end of the grueling 900-mile trip or loaded goods for a trip heading east.\n\nSan Miguel del Vado Church\nThis church, founded in 1806, was part of the first settlement encountered by early travelers on the Santa Fe Trail.

Each man had a tin cup and a tin plate scratched with its owner's mark. Salt pork was soaked overnight, cut into small pieces and fried or used as shortening in breads and stews. Coffee was essential and, in the early days, the beans were roasted each day over the fire.\n\nA Typical Day\n\nThe travelers rose early, hitched up their wagons and hit the trail. Stopping mid-morning, they put their herds out to pasture, had a light meal which was called breakfast, and then rested. At midday, the caravan stopped again to eat their main meal, an event called \"nooning.\" Scouts usually rode ahead to find water and possible campsites. After walking all afternoon, the caravan stopped for the night, made camp, greased their wagons, tended to their animals, and then ended the day with a light supper around the campfire.\n\nEncounters with Indians\n\nAlthough the clash of cultures brought about vicious behavior, with both sides attacking and retaliating, more trail travelers died from disease, accidents, or exposure than from Indian attacks. Many encounters were peaceful and trade with Indian tribes formed a large part of frontier life.\n\nTough Cures\n\nOne had to be hardy to survive an accident or illness on the trail, for first aid was a primitive business. Bleeding and purging were the accepted treatments for a variety of ailments and rather than cure the patient, those practices most often hastened an untimely death. The exception was the treatment for \"the ague\" (malaria). Quinine had just been accepted as a treatment and was dispensed in the form of Dr. Sappington's Anti-Fever Pills which were very effective.\n\nTyphoid, measles, and dysentery were problems. Cholera was a big killer and was treated with opium, camphor, and cayenne pepper, all of which did nothing to prevent a swift death. Gunpowder was sometimes burned onto the skin to treat snakebites.\n\nRubbing Up\n\nNear the end of the trail in preparation for their triumphant entry into Santa Fe, the travelers paused outside of town to \"rub up.\"\n\n\"The men here was their faces and hands and those possessed of that luxury would don a clean shirt. But those having no spare clothes would content themselves with fixing up shirts and trousers by substituting splinters for buttons and tying a handkerchief around their necks in such a way that it would cover the holes in their shirts as much as possible.\"\n\nJames Josiah Webb, trail trader, 1845\n\n(side quote:)\n\n\"We suffered greatly for want of salt; but, by burning the outside of our\u2026steaks, and sprinkling a little gunpowder upon them, it did not require a very extensive stretch of imagination to fancy the presence of both salt and pepper.\"\n\nCaptain Randolph B.

The industry employed hundreds of skilled woodworkers, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights to cut, shape, and assemble the huge vehicles. Initially built in Pennsylvania and shipped west, wagons later were manufactured nearer the trail heads as trail commerce expanded.\n\nBig Conestoga wagons, called \"Prairie Schooners\" because of their resemblance on the prairie to boats on a sea of grass, gave way later to box-shaped, heavier freight wagons, probably because they were quicker to build. \n\n(photo captions:)\n\n\u00b7As the trade grew along the trail, freight wagons became bigger and heavier. By the 1860s military supply wagons were carrying 10,000 lbs. of freight. The wagons had to withstand hundreds of miles of rough roads, river crossings, and severe weather. In the dry western climate, wagon wheels shrank and shims were put in between the wheel and the iron tire to keep the tire fastened to the rim. Often the wagons were sold in Santa Fe as the eastbound traders were transporting smaller goods on horses or mules.\n\n\u00b7With oxen teams, the teamsters walked along side; with mule teams the muleskinner often rode one of the wheelers. A \"hitch\" was two mules and average mule teams were 8 to 12 hitches long.\n\n\u00b7Initially pulled by oxen, by the end of the trail era the wagons were pulled mainly by mules. Both animals had their advantages and drawbacks. Oxen moved more slowly but could be eaten when things got tough and they were less skittish at river crossings. Mules were quicker but were more expensive and were frequent targets of Indian raids. A team of eight oxen could cost $200 compared to $600 for a team of six mules.\n\n\u00b7Wagon businesses, such as the Peter Schuttler Company, above, often minted tokens to advertise their products at the huge world fairs of the day, like the Paris Exposition of 1867 and the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876. Mainly spotlighting new technologies and inventions, the fairs also awarded medals for superior craftsmanship and innovation. To win a \"First Premium\" in either one would have helped the Schuttler wagon business.\n\n\u00b7Studebaker, later an automobile manufacturer, got its start as a wagon maker.

Establishing a ranch with 950 head of sheep, horses, cattle, and goats with her livestock brand, Josefa became the progenitor of generations of New Mexicans. The Village of Pajarito developed around the Baca family compound.\nPajarito Land Grant\nJosefa's son, Antonio, sold the Pajarito tract to Clemente Gutierrez. His heirs sought confirmation of their claim to the land from the surveyor general in 1877. The Court of Private Land Claims, on the presumption that a grant had been made to Josefa Baca, confirmed the Pajarito Land Grant in 1894 and patented it in 1914. Five generations after Josefa's death, her land and ranch remained with the same family, passing to a fifth great-granddaughter and direct descendant, Juliana Gutierrez, wife of James Hubbell.

You are standing at the entrance of the plaza, which offers a sense of the historical layout that changed throughout time but was typical of the Spanish colonial design. Much of the home life took place in the plaza. Constructed close to the agriculture fields and acequia, the plaza center included auxiliary structures: a storeroom, chicken coop, stable, kitchen garden, root cellar, and patio. Adobe was the material of choice, as well as terrones, sod blocks, cut from the river's edge. The plaza, with its enclosed walls, also provides a sense of safety for children playing games like hoops and marbles, servants busy tending to daily chores, and visitors being entertained. \n(captions from diagram:)\n\nThe low walls, east of where you are standing, outline the foundation of the mercantile (ca. 1868-1929) as well as a connected warehouse that was added in the 19th century. Local residents relied upon the mercantile for trade, and securing goods and foreign materials. It was also the base of operations for the family's trading business.\n\nThe portal, typical of territorial homes, opens up to the plaza keeping the house cool and serving as a place of gathering and relaxation. On a beautiful summer's night, residents may have heard traditional stories or songs on the porch at the end of a long day filled with family chores and the daily hard work of servants.\n\nThe hornos, or outdoor ovens, on the south end of the ramada were constructed in the Isleta Pueblo style that includes lava rock for insulation within adobe plaster. These ovens are used throughout New Mexico to bake bread and other traditional foods.\n\nThe ramada represents the historical structures that once stood in the area, including the chicken coop and storerooms. Oral histories note that the northern end of the structure featured high walls and a gun port for defense. Today, this area provides a functional space for public and private events while maintaining the picturesque view of the agriculture fields.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 620674, "filename": "620674.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 9, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "La Plazita Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 620675, "filename": "620675.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 9, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "La Plazita Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.69647, 34.9893]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 185714, "number": null, "title": "Vietnam War Memorial", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2006, "erected_by": null, "address": "711 Camino Del Pueblo", "city": "Bernalillo", "subcity": null, "county": "Sandoval County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Memorial is at the intersection of Camino Del Pueblo (New Mexico Route 313) and Calle Barrio Nuevo, on the right when traveling south on Camino Del Pueblo.

I was born in, New Mexico (Dawson), and this is where I developed my philosophy of social justice,\" said Delores Huerta April 1, 2017, at the re-naming of the South Valley Gateway Park in her honor.\n\nThe Bernalillo County Commission spearheaded the event and considered it well-deserved. As a child, Dolores relocated to Stockton, California with her mother and two brothers following her parents' divorce. Her mother worked two jobs to support her children, and Dolores' grandfather cared for the youngsters. Dolores admired her mother's spirit not only to provide financially, but to encourage activities for her children.\n\nEven though Dolores excelled in school, she served as the object of racism along with the Mexican, Mexican-American and farm-worker children. Dolores obtained a teaching degree at Stockton College and briefly worked as an elementary school teacher. Dolores left that career because she couldn't bear he poor living conditions of her students, many of them members of farm worker families. Dolores wanted to help them.\n\nIn 1960, she started the Agricultural Workers' Association (AWA) and organized voting registration drives and lobbied politicians to allow public assistance, pensions and he use of the Spanish language on public documents. In 1962, she and Cesar Chavez co-founded the National Farm Workers' Association (AFWA) which, in 1965, merged with the AWA. Five years of hard work on behalf of grape growers culminated in the signing of the historic agreement to improve more benefits for fam workers- unemployment and health care benefits and reducing the use of harmful pesticides. A 1970 lettuce boycott eventually paved the way for the passage of the 1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act.\n\nDolores continued in her activist father's tradition for many years after the death of her co-founder and good friend Cesar Chavez. She told the audience at the dedication that the honor is not only hers, but that of all who assisted in the movement.\n\n(photo captions:)\n\n\u00b7Dolores Huerta stands at the founding convention of the National Farm Workers Association in Fresno, California in 1962 with co-founder Cesar Chavez and others.\n\u00b7Portrait of Dolores Huerta wearing a \"There's blood on those grapes\" shirt.

The stretch of river south of Albuquerque was known as the \"Armijo crossing\" or the \"Atrisco Forde\" and was trusted as a good place to cross because of its shallow nature and its short distance from one side to the other. El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro also ran through the communities of Atrisco, Pajarito and Armijo along the present-day Isleta Blvd, before crossing the river. The early travelers on this route helped to support a thriving wool and weaving trade in the South Valley.\n\nThe Barelas Bridge was built in 1910, nearly 20 years after Albuquerque's first bridge, built in 1876, was washed away in the flood of 1891. In 1912, the Barelas Bridge was also flooded and then rebuilt. During this time, a ferry took people, freight, wagons and anything else across the river (Albuquerque Journal, June 29, 1912). However, after a short time, the ferry was docked and people were left to find another way to cross until a temporary foot bridge was constructed over the gap that people used while repairs were made. \n\nIn 1928, Federal Aid money paid for a two-lane, 20-ft bridge roadway with 6-ft sidewalks for pedestrian traffic. U.S. 85 (Isleta Blvd.) was also paved in the late 1920's and the increased traffic was more than the wooded bridge could handle. Especially because historic Route 66 also took travelers over the Barelas Bridge and through the Isleta corridor past what is now Dolores Huerta Gateway Park from 1926 to 1937, bringing an economy supported with filling stations, car mechanics and other businesses that catered to travelers.\n\nBy the 1940's rush hour traffic was bottlenecking over the bridge with so many people living in the South Valley and working East of the river. Construction began in 1953 on a new bridge. About 800 tons of steel were required to build the new bridge and steel shortages held up construction for some time (Albuquerque Tribune, May 13, 1954). Today, people cross the river at the same place to do many of the same things our ancestors did - to \"go visiting\" and stay connected to relatives in Barelas, to conduct business in the urban center of Albuquerque, and to travel to distant lands and home again.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 622270, "filename": "622270.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 17, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "River Crossing Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 622271, "filename": "622271.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 17, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "River Crossing Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is located at Dolores Huerta Gateway Park.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.6659, 35.06837]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 186095, "number": null, "title": "Cultural Lifeways", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Bernalillo County, New Mexico Mainstreet and South Valley MainStreet", "address": "100 Isleta Blvd SW", "city": "South Valley", "subcity": "West Side Addition", "county": "Bernalillo County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Isleta Boulevard SW (New Mexico Route 314) near Bridge Boulevard SW.

This marker is informed by oral histories collected from residents whose families lived and continue to live in the South Valley, some for at least five generations if not more. The saying, \"The more things change, the more they stay the same,\" often times rings true for the lifeways of the area. The rural South Valley exists as a historical, commercial and cultural crossroads along the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, a main trade route between Mexico and New Mexico. Past residents experienced an abundant commercial way of life, especially through the sheepherding industry. Community members valued their foods grown through the help of the acequias (ditches) and prepared by themselves.\n\nAgriculture continues to exist in the area, albeit in a different manner. Flower and vegetable gardens and small amounts of livestock form a household staple, with some still growing crops for family consumption. Some grow enough to sell locally.\n\nThe evolution of commerce changed from the wagons full of goods to trade along the Camino Real to stores where people shopped and gathered to visit. Children played hopscotch, baseball, football, jump-rope, played in the acequias (ditches) and the rio (river), and felt free to move safely about the community. Families continue to prepare and enjoy traditional foods such as rice pudding, chile, enchiladas, posole, frijoles, tamales and other traditional Indo-Hispano foods. To this day, many homes in the South Valley, exhibit grottos and capillas (chapels) in order to continue a belief system connected to the antepasados (ancestors) and as a way of saying, \"Thank you\" to the Creator, as a reflection of their religious and spiritual beliefs and for this traditional way of life.

Its waters reach out into the South Valley landscape through an intricate web of gravity-fed acequia waterways. When the ancestors cut the first diversion off the river, the landscape changed, creating opportunities for communities to farm, raise animals and thrive off of what they produced in connection to the land and the water.\n\nMany generations ago, ancestors of some of the current residents of the South Valley dug out the acequias, working together to create social, spiritual, cultural and physical connections with the landscape that are still experienced today in various forms. These connections remain despite multiple forms of government, efforts toward urbanization and policies that intended to disconnect people from their land and water rights. Acequia culture is built on a foundation of sharing resources, hard work, mutual support and building community.\n\nIn the past, people were communally connected to acequias as a means of survival, as a system of governance, as well as through everyday tasks like washing hair or clothes. Many current South Valley residents remember playing along the banks of the acequias, flying across on rope swings suspended from tall cottonwood trees and taking an occasional swim, even after their relatives warned them of the dangers of La Llorana, who also wanders along the acequias looking for her lost children. The acequias have always connected communities through a mutual dependency on water, but they also provide internal pathways where people walk and continue to connect with each other and with history.\n\nNow, there are ecological and environmental challenges in maintaining the health of the acequas, in addition to economic factors in maintaining a family farm. However, the waters still flow and community networks are actively woking to keep acequia culture alive today. Many of the thriving farms you see in the South Valley use acequia water and the ecological balance remains diverse. The acequia you see in front of you is a diversion from the Atrisco Drain, called the Rodgers Lateral, which travels south toward the Sanchez Farm Open Space and Isleta Pueblo.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 622328, "filename": "622328.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 18, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Acequia Culture Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 622330, "filename": "622330.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "November 18, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Acequia Culture Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.66506, 35.0669]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 186515, "number": null, "title": "The Caboose", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "City of Grants", "address": "100 Iron Avenue", "city": "Grants", "subcity": null, "county": "Cibola County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of Iron Avenue and U.S. 66, on the left when traveling north on Iron Avenue.

It was then moved to this site and renovated. \n Reverse Side\nHistory of the Railroad & Grants\n\nGrants and railroads have been inexplicably linked since the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad arrived in 1882. The three Grant brothers Angus, John and Lewis had the contract to build the railroad through Los Alamitos (the name of the first settlement in the area in 1872). For several years the railroad ended here until camps were established to continue the grading work west. More than 4000 men and more than 2000 mules worked the line through Grants as it inched west. The area became known as Grant's Camp and later as Grant's Station and eventually became Grant's. The apostrophe was removed in 1937 and it has been Grants ever since. \n\nThe Grant brothers maintained a telegraph at the end of the line for company business. The office soon became the source for local and national news. Stock pens for sheep, and cattle were built by the railroad so local ranchers could ship livestock east. During the hayday of railroads when Grants was a stop and had a depot, Hollywood actors, big name bands and famous athletes stopped off in Grants. In the 1920s the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad became the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe Railroad. Mainly known as the Santa Fe Railroad. In 1994 the ATSF merged with the Burlington Northern to become the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad.

She began the process of assembling the 40-square mile tract that became known as El Sitio de San Isidro de Pajarito Land Grant.\n\nJosefa's granddaughter, Josefa Apolonia Baca, married Clemente Guiterrez, a wealthy traveler from Aragon, Spain by way of Mexico City. Together, they expanded the family's land holdings, built acequias (irrigation ditches), developed farmlands, and became prosperous traders dominating the sheep trade along the Camino Real to Mexico. The Gutierrez family managed the business interests of the Catholic Church, served as military and political leaders, employed many villagers, and held peons and slaves.\n\nOur story deepens as Julianita Guiterrez, Apolonia's great-granddaughter, married James Lawrence Hubbell, a soldier in Kearny's Army of the West. Captain Hubbell, a fluent Spanish speaker, quickly became known as Santiago. He and Julianita built a grand estate, part of which survives here today. Together they established a remarkable, multi-cultural homestead and extended the economic, social, and political influence of the family into the 20th century.\n\nCaptain Hubbell leads a local company of New Mexican Mounted Volunteers in the Union Army and later serves with Kit Carson in campaigns against the Mescalero. \n\nSon J.L. Hubbell builds his first trading post on the Navajo Reservation.\n\nThere is much to learn here about struggles to survive, intrigues between powerful families, peons and slaves, civil war battles, Indian traders, early farming and ranching, and more. The history of these families captures the larger tale of New Mexico and the Southwest.\n\nWelcome to our continuing story. The Gutierrez-Hubbell House has been listed on the State Register of Cultural Properties since 1976. In 2000, a grass root effort by the surrounding community led to this historic property being purchased and preserved by Bernalillo County. Today, the Center is used for a variety of purposes that include interactive exhibits, public and private events, school programs, and tours.\n\nOur trails and fields are open and free for your enjoyment. Bernalillo County Open Space sponsors many free events at the Center throughout the year. For more information visit www.bernco.gov/openspace.\n\nThe house and its exhibits may be toured during visiting hours. For additional information or to arrange private events, visit the Hubbell House Alliance website at www.hubbellhousealliance.org or call 505.244.0507.\n\n(Spanish:)\n\nEl capitan Cristobal Baca y Don Pedro Gomez Duran y Chavez llegan a San Gabriel, la colonia desde la Ciudad de Mexico.\n\nNuestra historia empieza con Josefa Baca, una mujer joven y valiente, que compro esta propiedad done tu estas pisando ahora mismo. Ella comenzo a juntar la extension de 40 millas cuadradas que llego a ser La Merced del Sitio de San Isidro de Pajarito.\n\nLa nieta de Josefa, Josefa Apolonia Baca, se caso con Clemente Guiterrez, un viajero rico de Aragon, Espana, que paso por la Cuidad de Mexico. Josefa Apolonia y Clemente extendieron los terrenos familiares, construyon acequias (canales de riego), desarrollaron tierras de siembra, y llegaron a ser comerciantes prosperos, dominando el comercio de ovejas a lo largo del Camino Real a Mexico. La familia Gutierrez manejo los intereses comerciales de la Iglesia Catolica, sirvio como lideres militares y politicos, empleo mucha gente de la comunidad y detuvo peones y esclavos.\n\nSe profundiza nuestra historia cuando Julianita Gutierrez, la bisnieta de Apolonia se casa con James Lawrence Hubbell, un soldado en el Ejercito del Oeste de Kearny. El capitan Hubbell, hablaba espanol muy bien y al poco tiempo toda la comunidad lo conocia como Santiago. El y Julianita construyeon una casa grande, esta que ves aqui hoy dia. Juntos establecieron una notable residencia multicultural y extendieron la inuencia politica, social, y economica de la familia hasta el siglo viente.\n\n\nEl capitan Hubbel guia una compania de Voluntarios Nuevo Mezicanos Montados en el Ejercito de La Union y despues sirve con Kit Carson en campanas contra los indios nescaleros.\n\nEl hijo, J.L. Hubbell construys su primer puesto comercial en la reservacion navajo.\n\nHay mucho que aprender aqui sobre como sobrevivir, las intrigas entre las familias poderosas, los peones y los esclavos, las batallas de la guerra civil, los comerciantes indios, la primera agricultura y ganaderia, y mas. La historia de estas familias representa una leyenda mas grande de Nuevo Mexico y del Suroeste.\n\nBienvenidos, a la continuacion de nuestra historia. La Casa Guiterrez-Hubbell ha estado en el Registro Estatal de Propiedades Culturales desde 1976.

Looking south, they listened always for the sounds of an arriving caravan.\nBy the mid 1700s, two-way trade between Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Chihuahua, Mexico was flourishing. New Mexico's prized woven textiles and raw materials were exchanged for manufactured goods from around the world, including high-priced items intended for the colony's elite.\n\nClemente Gutierrez, whose great granddaughter built this house, became a major force in trade along this Royal Road. He sent thousands of sheep south and profited from his storehouse where other settlers brought their goods to be packed into caravans and sold in the south. Clemente's son, Lorenzo, and his grandson Juan Nepomuceno, continued this trade while building their herds and farm fields. James Hubbell, Juan's son-in-law, maintained this trade into the 1880s, but also expanded the family's trading to the east and west along other trails.\n\nHeaded South\nsheep and other livestock \u2022 animal hides \u2022 buckskins \u2022 wool fleeces \u2022 woven blankets \u2022 stockings \u2022 government documents \u2022 mail \u2022 beeswax candles \u2022 captured Indians \u2022 pottery \u2022 pinon nuts \u2022 salt \u2022 tobacco\nComing North\nmetal tools \u2022 weapons \u2022 gunpowder \u2022 iron \u2022 steel \u2022 silver \u2022 furniture \u2022 mail \u2022 food \u2022 sugar \u2022 wine \u2022 olive oil \u2022 oysters \u2022 chocolate \u2022 religious depictions and devotions \u2022 barrels of sacramental wine fine \u2022 government documents \u2022 musical instruments \u2022 porcelain \u2022 majolica \u2022 mirrors \u2022 Chinese silk \u2022 fabrics \u2022 clothing \u2022 paper \u2022 shoes \u2022 medicine\n\n(Spanish:)\nMira hacia el sur. Desde los primeros d\u00edas de la frontera de Nuevo M\u00e9xico, el camino que ten\u00eda ante usted era el Camino Real, el \u00fanico v\u00ednculo con el mundo m\u00e1s amplio. Viajar en el recorrido de 1600 millas estuvo lleno de peligros: robo, ataques de indios, fr\u00edo o calor extremos, hambre o sed, lesiones o muerte. Sin embargo, era la \u00fanica conexi\u00f3n con la gente y los mercados de M\u00e9xico. El \u00fanico enlace a Espa\u00f1a. Cualquier cosa que los colonos necesitaran que no pudieran hacer ellos mismos, o encontrar localmente, solo se pod\u00eda obtener de las caravanas que recorr\u00edan el Camino cada pocos a\u00f1os. Mirando hacia el sur, siempre escucharon los sonidos de una caravana que llegaba.\n\nA mediados de la d\u00e9cada de 1700, el comercio de ida y vuelta entre Santa Fe, Albuquerque y Chihuahua, M\u00e9xico, estaba floreciendo. Los preciados tejidos y materias primas de Nuevo M\u00e9xico se intercambiaron por productos manufacturados de todo el mundo, incluidos art\u00edculos de alto precio destinados a la clasa alta de la colonia.\n\nClemente Guti\u00e9rrez, cuya bisnieta construy\u00f3 esta casa, se convirti\u00f3 en una fuerza importante en el comercio a lo largo de este Camino Real. Envi\u00f3 miles de ovejas al sur y se benefici\u00f3 de su almac\u00e9n donde otros colonos tra\u00edan sus mercanc\u00edas para empaquetarlas en caravanas y venderlas en el sur. El hijo de Clemente, Lorenzo, y su nieto Juan Nepomuceno, continuaron este oficio mientras constru\u00edan sus reba\u00f1os y campos de cultivo. James Hubbell, el yerno de Juan, mantuvo este comercio en la d\u00e9cada de 1880, pero tambi\u00e9n expandi\u00f3 el comercio de la familia hacia el este y el oeste a lo largo de otros senderos.\n\nHacia al Sur\n\nlas ovejas y otro ganado \u2022 pieles de venado \u2022 bufalo \u2022 alce \u2022 vaca \u2022 venado y nutrias \u2022 piel de ovea \u2022 mantas y medias tejidas \u2022 documentos gubernamentales \u2022 correo \u2022 velas de cera de abea \u2022 indios cautivos \u2022 ceramica \u2022 pinon \u2022 sal \u2022 tabaco\n\nViniendo al norte\n\nHerramientas de metal \u2022 armas \u2022 polvora \u2022 hierro \u2022 acero \u2022 plata \u2022 muebles \u2022 correo \u2022 aceite de oliva \u2022 pinturas religiosas y exvotos \u2022 medicamentosintrumentos \u2022 seda china y otras telas \u2022 barriles de vino sacramental \u2022 documentos gubernamentales \u2022 porcelana fina \u2022 musicales \u2022 ceramica \u2022 espejos \u2022 ropa \u2022 papel \u2022 zapatos \u2022 ostiones \u2022 chocolate \u2022 alimentos \u2022 azucar \u2022 vino \u2022 delicias", "photos": [{"photo_id": 626902, "filename": "626902.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "December 9, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "El Camino Real Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 626903, "filename": "626903.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "December 9, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "El Camino Real Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.69611, 34.98883]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 188222, "number": null, "title": "Juliana Gutierrez y Chaves Hubbell / Gutierrez-Hubbell House", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "New Mexico Historic Preservation Division", "address": "6036 Isleta Blvd SW", "city": "South Valley", "subcity": "Hubble Acres", "county": "Bernalillo County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on Isleta Boulevard Southwest (New Mexico Route 314) south of Las Rosa Road, on the right when traveling south.

In 1849, at the age of 16, she wed trader and army officer James Lawrence Hubbell through an arranged marriage. The couple built on extensive ranch that supported a mercantile and post office, orchards, vineyards, and pasturelands for livestock, which they raised and traded. With James often away on business, Juliana managed the property, becoming the matriarch of one of the most successful trading families in New Mexico history and helping establish the modern village of Pajarito. Their Ranch is preserved today as the historic Gutierrez - Hubbell House.\n\nGutierrez-Hubbell House\n\nConstructed in four phases in the Territorial style, the first eight rooms of the house were built from 1855-1859 around a large central hall, an architectural innovation in New Mexico at the time. The design was influenced by Eastern styles admired by Hubbell. The three-room kitchen ell added in the mid-1860s formed a placita, one of the home's key Hispanic architectural elements along with its 27-inch-thick adobe walls, flat roof, vigas, and milled planks. In 1867, two bedrooms were added and a year later the large mercantile wing built north of them. The foot print of the 19-room, rambling structure is still evident. Thirteen of the rooms remain.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 627930, "filename": "627930.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "December 14, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Juliana Gutierrez y Chaves Hubbell / Gutierrez-Hubbell House Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3864, "height": 5152, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 627931, "filename": "627931.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "December 14, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Juliana Gutierrez y Chaves Hubbell / Gutierrez-Hubbell House Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3864, "height": 5152, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 627932, "filename": "627932.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "December 14, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Juliana Gutierrez y Chaves Hubbell / Gutierrez-Hubbell House Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is on the grounds of Gutierrez-Hubbell House and can be seen on El Camino Road.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 627934, "filename": "627934.jpeg", "photographer": "Jason Voigt", "taken": "October 13, 2021", "submitted": "December 14, 2021, by Jason Voigt of Glen Carbon, Illinois.", "caption": "Juliana Gutierrez y Chaves Hubbell / Gutierrez-Hubbell House Marker", "subcaption": "north view with part of the house in the background", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 5152, "height": 3864, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 766612, "filename": "766612.jpeg", "photographer": "Flexible Fotography", "taken": "October 12, 2023", "submitted": "December 28, 2023, by Flexible Fotography of San Diego, California.", "caption": "Juliana Gutierrez y Chaves Hubbell / Gutierrez-Hubbell House Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 2640, "height": 1980, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-106.69607, 34.98878]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 189205, "number": null, "title": "Joseph's Bar & Grill, Santa Rosa, New Mexico", "subtitle": "Route 66 Roadside Attraction", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2003, "erected_by": "Hampton Hotels Save-a-Landmark program", "address": "1775 U.S. Rte 66", "city": "Santa Rosa", "subcity": null, "county": "Guadalupe County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is on Business Interstate 40 west of Greig Avenue, on the right when traveling west. <font color=red> Reported permanently removed.</font>", "missing": "Confirmed Missing", "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=189205", "description": "Originally La Fiesta Caf\u00e9, Joseph's was opened in 1956.

Characteristics of this style of building consist of standard brick, symmetrical-gable roofed passenger areas, parapets on the edges of the roof, and waiting rooms on either side of the agents bay. The size of a depot was determined by the size of the town, so a specifically sized depot could accommodate rail traffic for that town.\nLook closely at the peak of the building and you can see the famous ATSF symbol that was adopted in 1901. This symbol found on the Las Cruces Depot is unique in that it is permanently embedded in the stucco. Most other depots only have the trademark painted on the sides of the building.\nPassenger service at the Depot ended in 1968, while freight service at the Depot lasted until 1988. A few years later, the ATSF donated the Depot to the City of Las Cruces, and it was converted into a museum in 2004.\n[Captions]\n\u2022 (Top) New Mexico State University Library, Archives and Special Collections\n\u2022 (Bottom left) Las Cruces Railroad Depot, ca. 1910\n\u2022 (Bottom right) Las Cruces, NM, ca 1965.

These \"fish eagles\" are excellent fliers with strong legs and powerful talons.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s the osprey population decreased dramatically from hunting, habitat loss and the use of insecticides such as DDT. These chemicals contaminated rivers, poisoning the fish that made up 99 percent of the osprey diet. Fortunately, DDT was banned, and the osprey population began to recover.\n\nToday, as osprey return, they face another obstacle. Osprey often build nests in tall, isolated areas, close to shallow bodies of water. Many utility poles were built in their absence and osprey began to build nests on these power poles. Conservation efforts include building artificial nest platforms in an effort to increase the osprey population.\n\nWhat do you give a sick bird?

After his military service he went straight back to the oil patch working for himself until a fire put him out of business.\n\nThe disaster did not destroy his resolve. After reestablishing himself, he formed Mack Chase, Inc., operating approximately 20 rigs. With the end of his partnership with John R.

The oil and gas operating company was a growing success for 20 years, reaching a production level of 2,700 barrels of oil per day.\n\nIn 1992, Chase and Gray opted to dissolve the business partnership to pursue their individual business interests and operating philosophies. They divided the production evenly. Within one year, each company had reached the production level they had shared in the partnership.

At age 12 he began roughnecking and by age 19 he drilled his first commercial well.\n\nVan went on to drill wells in the eastern United States and eventually settled in Robertson, Illinois, with his wife, Gertrude. They had five children, Van. Wendell, Marjorie, Phoebe and Jimmy. From Illinois, Van took on various exploration expeditions that included Canada and Wyoming, where he drilled the discovery well in the prolific Elk Hills Basin.\n\nVan had often heard of activities in the Southwest United States. In 1923, he made an exploration trip with his rig to New Mexico, where he drilled two dry holes west of the Pecos River near Dayton. Discouraged, he was prepared to move his rig to Texas. Instead, Martin Yates convinced him to stay and the partnership of Flynn, Welch and Yates (FWY) was established. After buying out the interest of his old partner, Thomas Flynn, Van had a 118/144 (or 81.9%) interest in the partnership of FWY.\n\nThe company selected a location 7 miles east of the Pecos River for the Illinois #1, which had an encouraging oil show. In January 1924, \u00be of a mile west of #1, the Illinois #2 blew out during drilling at an estimated rate of 4 million cubic feet per day and was dubbed \"The Big Gasser.\" Van was able to move the rig off unharmed and, after a month, the location for the Illinois #3, \u00bd mile northeast of #1, was selected. History was made in April 1924, when the Illinois #3 produced the first commercial oil on New Mexico State Lands.\n\nVan settled in Artesia where he continued to explore in New Mexico and elsewhere. He contributed much to the community and to charities until his death in 1969 at age 89. Van was distinguished by being elected Pioneer of Pioneers at the International Petroleum Exposition in 1966. He was one of the original 10 men inducted into the Permian Basin Oil Man Hall of Fame when it opened in late 1969.\n\nThis monument was commissioned by the descendants of Van Welch, created by Robert Summers, and cast by Hoka Hay Foundry.\nJuly 2, 2005", "photos": [{"photo_id": 757695, "filename": "757695.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane and Tracy Marsteller", "taken": "October 9, 2023", "submitted": "October 31, 2023, by Duane and Tracy Marsteller of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "caption": "Van Stratton Welch Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4032, "height": 3024, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 757696, "filename": "757696.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane and Tracy Marsteller", "taken": "October 9, 2023", "submitted": "October 31, 2023, by Duane and Tracy Marsteller of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "caption": "Van Stratton Welch Marker", "subcaption": "Featured marker is on the far right.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4032, "height": 3024, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-104.40337, 32.84201]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 235360, "number": null, "title": "The Illinois #3", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2004, "erected_by": null, "address": null, "city": "Artesia", "subcity": null, "county": "Eddy County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of West Main Street (U.S. 82) and South 6th Street, on the right when traveling east on West Main Street.

At some time in late April or May, the well unloaded and the now famous photograph was taken. Later in June 1924, the well-known \"shooter,\" Tex Thornton, set off downhole nitroglycerin explosions to improve the well's performance. The oil business in Southeast New Mexico was here to stay.\n\nThe operators of the original well were Flynn, Welch and Yates. Tom Flynn and Van Welch had a partnership called Illinois Producers, and had brought a cable tool rig and crew to New Mexico in search of oil. Several failures had them packing to leave the state when Martin Yates convinced them to stay and try again on New Mexico state leases Yates had obtained. The #1 well was dry, the #2 discovered a large, unwanted volume of natural gas (in a time of no natural gas markets), so the #3 had to be successful, and at 1,947 feet, it was.\n\nThe geologist was V. H. McNutt, who, after the #1 and #2 failures, waved in a general direction but wouldn't be more specific as to the #3 site. The decision was passed on to Martin, who, in turn, elected for a woman's intuition, asking his wife, Mary, to pick the site, and she did. The rest is history.\n\nSince 1924, Southeast New Mexico has produced approximately 3.9 billion barrels of oil and 20.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas out of tens of thousands of wells. The state of New Mexico permanent fund, into which its oil and gas royalties flow, with the help of San Juan basin gas in Northwest New Mexico, has grown to over $5 billion.\n\nThe \"Woman's Intuition\" monument was commissioned by descendants of Mary and Martin Yates, created by Robert Summers, and cast by Eagle Bronze Foundry.\nApril 24, 2004", "photos": [{"photo_id": 757697, "filename": "757697.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane and Tracy Marsteller", "taken": "October 9, 2023", "submitted": "October 31, 2023, by Duane and Tracy Marsteller of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "caption": "The Illinois #3 Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4032, "height": 3024, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 757699, "filename": "757699.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane and Tracy Marsteller", "taken": "October 9, 2023", "submitted": "October 31, 2023, by Duane and Tracy Marsteller of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "caption": "The Illinois #3 Marker", "subcaption": "Featured marker is the one closest to the camera.", "cr": "\nCopyright \u00a9 _x000D_\n2005\u20132024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 4032, "height": 3024, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-104.40334, 32.84202]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 235362, "number": null, "title": "Martin Yates, Jr.", "subtitle": "1882-1949", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": null, "city": "Artesia", "subcity": null, "county": "Eddy County", "state": "New Mexico", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of West Main Street (U.S. 82) and South 6th Street, on the right when traveling east on West Main Street.

A diamond symbol (\u2666) next to the name indicates that the soldier did not survive to return home.\n\nThe history of these regiments prepared by Jack W. Bradley, U.S. Army retired, is outlined beginning on the reverse side of this column and continuing on the column to the east.\n\nBataan Memorial Park was dedicated by Clyde Tingley, Chairman of the Albuquerque City Commission, in 1943 as a Living Monument to the men who served in the defense of the Bataan Peninsula. In 1960 The Bataan Club erected the original stone memorial in recognition of the service of the men of the 200th and the 515th. The State of New Mexico placed Bataan Memorial Park on the State Register of Cultural Properties in 1999.\n\nThis Memorial dedicated April 7, 2002, was created by the Bataan-Corregidor Memorial Foundation of New Mexico with the support and participation of the City of Albuquerque and the New Mexico State Legislature.\n\n(List of officials' names)\n\n[Historical marker] (Photo #3)\n200th and 515th Coast Artillery (AA)\nIn Defense of the Philippines\nOn December 8, 1941, only nine hours after the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, the 200th Coast Artillery engaged Japanese bombers at Clark Field and Fort Stotsenberg, becoming the first unit to go into action in defense of the U.S. flag in the Philippines. Despite having outmoded weapons and faulty ammunition, the 200th scored eight confirmed hits and lost two men.\n\nThat evening, 500 soldiers from the original regiment of 1800 men were sent to provide additional air defense in Manila. This provisional force was christened the 515th Coast Artillery and became America's first war-born regiment in World War II. At that time the soldiers of the 200th and 515th were part of a total of 27,000 American troops in the Philippines along with 98,000 Filipino soldiers.\n\nWhen Japanese forces under the command of Lt. General Masaharu Homma landed on December 22, 1941, the 200th and 515th were among the troops who fought valiantly with little hope of reinforcements or supplies. New Mexicans were involved in every defensive battle waged in the jungles of Bataan and on the small island fortress of Corregidor.\n\n\u201cWe're the battling bastards of Bataan;\nNo mama, no papa, no Uncle Sam;\nNo aunts, no uncles, no nephews, no nieces;\nNo pills, no planes, no artillery pieces;\nAnd nobody gives a damn.\u201d\n- Frank Hewlett, war correspondent, UPI\nThe defense of the Philippines lasted four months. It gave the Allied Pacific forces the precious time needed to regroup and delay Japanese aggressions in the Asia Pacific region. Shortly before the fall of Bataan, General Douglas MacArthur left Corregidor for Australia, pledging \u201cI shall return.\u201d\n\n[POW marker] (Photo #4)\n200th and 515th Coast Artillery (AA)\nPrisoners of War\nOn April 9, 1942, the weakened survivors from the combined American and Filipino forces were unconditionally surrendered to the Japanese by Major General Edward King. Thus began one of the most cruel and unrelenting prisoner of war episodes in modern U.S. history.\n\nMost POWs were assembled in Mariveles at the southern tip of the Bataan peninsula and forced to march to San Fernando, Pampanga. Wounded men were assisted by able-bodied prisoners or carried on crude stretchers. Stragglers were beaten or killed. Civilians who showed mercy to the prisoners endured a similar fate. The incident covered a distance of 104 kilometers (65 miles) and became known as the Bataan Death March.\n\nThe final leg of the northward journey was completed inside stifling railway boxcars that took them to the prison set up at Camp O'Donnell near the town of Capas, Tarlac. Most of the American POWs were eventually transferred to Cabanatuan in Nueva Ecija. The captured soldiers were subjected to inhumane conditions. Death from malnutrition, disease and abuse was a common occurance. More than 4,000 American POWs and 25,000 Filipino POWs died in these two camps alone.\n\nPrison camps became the staging places for forced labor. POWs were routinely relocated to distant work camps in Manchuria, Formosa, Japan, Korea and throughout the Philippine islands. The Japanese transported prisoners aboard unmarked vessels and many POWs died when Allied forces mistakenly attacked these \u201chell ships\u201d.\n\nOn August 15, 1945 the Japanese surrendered. The liberation forces rescued approximately 1,000 brutalized and malnourished POWs from the 200th and 515th. Due to their weak condition, nearly a fourth of them died shortly after returning to the United States.\n\nNew Mexico earned the tragic distinction of having the highest prisoner of war population per capita of any state in the Union. The plight of New Mexico soldiers motivated next-of-kin and organizations throughout the state to participate in government war relief efforts and to raise funds for the International Red Cross. \u201cRemember Bataan\u201d became one of America's most enduring wartime credos.\n\n[Legacy marker] (Photo #5)\n200th and 515th Coast Artillery (AA)\nHistorical Legacy\nThe 200th Coast Artillery (AA) has a distinguished military legacy. The unit was established in 1939 from elements of the 111th Cavalry, New Mexico National Guard. The 111th Cavalry had its origin in the territorial militias of the 1850s and fought in the U.S. Civil War, in the Spanish-American War as \u201cRough Riders,\u201d and in World War I.\n\nAfter the 200th was inducted into federal service, recruits joined from all walks of New Mexican life. They enlisted in centers in Albuquerque, Carlsbad, Clovis, Gallup, Santa Fe, Silver City and Taos. Many young men deferred going to college. Many chose to leave their small towns and rural villages for the first time in their lives.\n\nOn January 6, 1941, the 200th was sent to the Anti-Aircraft Training Center at Fort Bliss, Texas, where draftees augmented its ranks. At the end of the training, the 200th was cited as the best anti-aircraft unit in the U.S. Armed Forces. In August, General George C. Marshall's action letter ordered the immediate dispatch of the 200th to the Philippines. By the end of the month, the 200th set sail from San Francisco, California.\n\nThe survivors of the 200th and the 515th are among the most highly decorated soldiers in American history. They have received four Presidential Unit Citations, five Battle Stars, the Bronze Star, the Bataan Medal issued by the State of New Mexico and a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nThe 200th and 515th shall forever be remembered for fighting against all odds. They fought and paid a huge price for the freedom Americans enjoy today. General Douglas MacArthur noted, \u201cNo troops have ever done so much with so little.\u201d To these men we remain eternally grateful.\n\n\u201cOur resolve as a nation will be tested in the future. Be prepared to defend the ideals of democracy.\u201d \u2013 Surviving veterans, 200th and 515th Coast Artillery (AA), April 2002\n\n200th and 515th Coast Artillery (AA) Officers (Photos #6 & #7)\nJoseph L.

In this large, mostly rural state with few doctors, midwives, called parteras in Spanish, have helped women give birth to thousands of babies.

Conceived as 'Acequia Crossings', Lavadie created a\nseries of stencil designs to educate and remind locals and visitors of the disappearing\nacequias.\nAcequias are centuries old community-operated water channels used for agricultural\nirrigation. It is a word that conveys both the physical irrigation ditch and the community that\nshares and maintains the water that runs through it. Pronounced 'As-SAY-kee-ah, The word\nderives from the Arabic term, As-Saquiya, it's root \"saqa\" meaning to irrigate.\nThe approach to the design was to connect to the liquid feeling of water and of water currents.\nTo represent acequias, there are three key elements: water, human interaction with water, and\nagriculture.\nWater:\nThe idea of the design was to depict the flow of water. The water stencil imitates the random\ncourse of water flow within the confines of the land banks that flank the acequia.\nShovel:\nThis is how the farmer and acequia parciante manages the water, with the shovel. It is as basic\nand simple as it gets. With all the complexities of knowing the land, the seasons, the water\n-the acequia parciante needs and flow and with cooperative work with the community\nshares the water to prosper and thrive.\nSeeds:\nThe three stages are depicted together in a row. They represent the most time-consuming and\nlaborious aspect of being acequia parciantes. The garden, the field of crops, the livestock, and\nthe family members who depend on the harvest are all reliant on the work with land, water,\nand seed. Once the seeds sprout, the constant care and work is needed with thriving plants all\nthe days, weeks, and months into cosecha (harvest).\nLearn more about acequias and acequia culture: www.taosacequias.org", "photos": [{"photo_id": 760848, "filename": "760848.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

After returning to New York, he and Phillips embarked on a wagon trip from Colorado to Mexico. A broken wheel forced the pair to halt their adventure in Taos. Blumenschein returned to Paris and later to New York where he resumed his highly successful career as an illustrator. Although he visited Taos on a regular basis, it wasn't until 1919 that he moved here permanently. Blumenschein was an exacting artist often repainting canvases after several years had passed. As a result of his high standards, only his best work survives to this day.CaptionChurch at Ranchos", "photos": [{"photo_id": 761518, "filename": "761518.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

Suddenly you could travel from Kansas City to Las Vegas in days, not months. But the arrival of the railroad marked the end for one of the great overland trails. The Santa Fe Trail had been an important highway of commerce for almost 60 years, running between Missouri and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Travelers and traders had struggled to cover the arduous 900 miles, which often took two months or more. And now the trip could be made, in the comfort of a railway coach, in a few days.\n\nThe railroad spawned a population boom attracting newcomers both respectable and lawless. Legendary outlaws such as Billy the Kid, Jesse James, and Doc Holliday all visited Las Vegas.\n\nQueen of the West\nLas Vegas, founded in 1835, and named for the meadows that surrounded it, was an important stop on the Santa Fe Trail. It quickly prospered due to the constant trail traffic, and by 1850, was the most important city between Kansas City and Santa Fe. It continued to prosper after the railroad arrived and into the early years of the 20th century. It was the \u201cQueen of the West\u201d boasting the finest hotels, restaurants, drinking establishments, mercantile houses, and opera houses.\n\nTrail Sites Nearby\nLas Vegas Plaza From a rooftop on the north side of Las Vegas Plaza, General Stephen Watts Kearny proclaimed New Mexico as part of the rapidly expanding United States in 1846.

He left home at an early age and became an\nadept trapper and scout using the knowledge he learned from the many Native American tribes he encountered in his younger years. By his natural talents and the skills he learned early on, Carson went on to become one of the most dramatic and important figures of the American\nWest. He was a frontiersman, trapper, scout, guide, transcontinental courier, U.S. Brigadier General, Indian Agent, husband and father. In the\n1840s Carson joined explorer John C. Fr\u00e9mont on several expeditions to map the western lands that would become California and Oregon. Carson's innate abilities in so many areas and his success with the Fr\u00e9mont expeditions gained him national recognition.\nFamiliar with the New Mexico Territory via his extensive travels Carson decided to settle in Taos in 1843. Here he met a beautiful young Hispanic girl named Maria Josefa Jaramillo, daughter of the prominent Jaramillo family of Taos. Kit and Maria Josefa married in February of 1843 and for the next 25 years this traditional adobe dwelling was their home. As U.S. Indian Agent, Carson used one of the home's three rooms as his office,\ndictating reports imploring the U.S. government to honor all Indian treaties and provide tribal support. Kit and Josefa lived in this home with\nseven of their nine children until 1867 when the family moved to Colorado. In April, 1868, Josefa died at age forty of complications from her last\nchildbirth. One month later Kit died from a burst aneurysm in his neck - he was fifty-nine. They are buried here in Taos.Caption The Carson Home\nin the 1860s\nVisit the grave sites of Kit and Josefa\na few short blocks from here in\nThe Kit Carson Memorial Cemetery.\n113 Kit Carson Road, Taos, New Mexico 87571\n575-758-4945\nkitcarsonmuseum.org", "photos": [{"photo_id": 761556, "filename": "761556.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

He attended Lodge meetings by riding on horseback through the Rio Grande pass, the same route used today to reach Santa Fe from Taos. In 1860 he became a founding member of Bent Lodge #42 in Taos. After the deaths of Kit and Josefa in 1868, this home and all of their belongings were sold to support their seven orphaned children. From that time forward the house changed hands several times and was often leased out. The house grew neglected and fell into\nserious disrepair - by the early 1900s the dwelling was near collapse.\nIn 1909, the Grand Masonic Lodge of New Mexico stepped in to save the home of New Mexico's most famous Mason and tasked Bent Lodge with raising the funds\nrequired to purchase and restore the home.\nThe members of Bent Lodge were successful and purchased the house in 1910 for $2,100. After another two years of difficult fund raising, Bent Lodge started renovations on the site. Then, in 1952, the Kit Carson Memorial Fund was formed and took over fiscal management of the site. In 1963 the U.S. National Parks\nService granted house National Historic Landmark status.\nBecause of the tireless efforts of Bent Lodge and the Grand Lodge of New Mexico, Kit Carson's home still stands today. Now called, The Kit Carson Home and\nMuseum, the site is an established 501c3 cultural non-profit. Although the site is still owned by the Masonic Lodge, it is managed and maintained by the non-profit\nMuseum.
