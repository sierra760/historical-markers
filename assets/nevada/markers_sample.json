In November 1894 a dispute between Pat Green and Pat Dolan over the building’s location turned violent with Dolan killing Green in a gunfight. With successful mining operations the area population grew to 6000 people and a peak enrollment of 56 students. In 1901 a lantern was fueled with gasoline and exploded. The fire burned several buildings nearly destroying the schoolhouse. After the last class in 1941, the building was used as a post office until 1971. Acquired by Walter Campbell in 1994, the schoolhouse has been converted into a museum.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 1, "filename": "1.jpeg", "photographer": "Sierra Burkhart", "taken": "May 19, 2022", "submitted": "June 24, 2007, by Sierra Burkhart of San Diego, California.", "caption": "Cherry Creek School Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 3024, "height": 4032, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.88885, 39.90072]}}]}
