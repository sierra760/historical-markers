In November, 1866, milling was begun on Pahranagat ores and soon after, Hiko became the first county seat of Lincoln County in March 1867.

In 1860, the Pony Express Company used the same facilities, and when the telegraph arrived in 1863, it passed over this same route.\n\nDuring the rush to Virginia City mines in 1859 and 1860, it became necessary for the army to send troops to this point to protect the personnel of that western pilgrimage.\n\nSilver ore was discovered in the mountains immediately to the east of Schellbourne in the early 1870's, and it became part of the Aurum Mining District in 1871. An active mining camp developed, with a population of over 500 persons. By 1885, the ore had been mostly depleted and the camp abandoned. The district and adjacent valley were then acquired by \"Uncle Billy\" Burke as a ranch.

Most of the early activity had ceased by 1883, but in 1897 there was a great revival in mining activity which lasted into the early 1900’s. During this period, prior to the completion of the Nevada Northern Railroad in 1906, freight and passenger traffic was via long strings of massive freight wagons and stagecoaches from Toano and Wells.

The verdant meadows watered by the springs had been seasonally inhabited by the Paiute Indians for centuries. The water and the meadows made Las Vegas an important stop on the Spanish Trail (called the Mormon Road after 1848).\n\nPresident Young directed this group of newly called missionaries to become self-sufficient, to provide a place of rest and security for travelers between California and Salt Lake City, and to teach the Indians the gospel of Jesus Christ. In the heat of the summer, in June 1855, the missionaries arrived at this site. The mission, intended to be permanent, was the first Anglo-American settlement in Las Vegas Valley.\n\nBy summer’s end their irrigated gardens were producing fresh vegetables and grains. A new fort was under construction, and a spirit of cooperation and mutual learning was being established with the native inhabitants.

The year was 1877, and Will, a youthful participant in establishing the town, was a keen observer. He listened to debates, took note of critical decisions, and became skilled in diplomacy. In his youth, Will raised melons, picked cotton,, cared for animals, and made molasses. Later, he delivered mail pony express style, peddled produce to mining camps, hauled salt from St. Thomas to Silver Reef mine, and herded three thousand steer from Arizona to Utah.\n\nAfter completing a mission to Illinois for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, William was called to be bishop of the Mesquite Ward, a position he held from 1901 until 1927. His involvement in church and community affairs was unequaled and his leadership extended to all people. He was on the town board, school board, board of directors of the grape farm, and chairman of the telephone committee. Will was involved in the building of a bridge between Mesqute and Bunkerville—and when completed—he was in charge of the Bridge Day Celebration. He was a judge, justice of the peace, farmer, delegate to the International Irrigation Congress, and amateur dentist, and with his wife, ran a hotel and café.\n\nWilliam championed the road-building cause He surveyed the original road between Las Vegas and Mesquite. He campaigned for and took charge of the construction of a road which was one hundred feet in width and a mile-and-a-half long. This was a grueling, three year project as even a bird couldn’t fly through the dense, impassable underbrush The road is now known as Mesquite Boulevard.\n\nMaintaining the dam was also a challenge. When the all-too-familiar cry, the damn dam is out, spread by word of mouth, men promptly transported available teams and wagons to the dam site. William wrote, I have worked in the river building dams in water to my neck for two and three weeks at a time. We put into our dam at one time 300 loads of brush and 500 loads of rock.\n\nThe establishment of Mesquite was not a one-man effort. Settlers moved in for a variety of reasons and were endowed with a diversity of talents. It tool strong minded and strong-backed men with unwavering conviction to make Mesquite a viable community; men who were willing to surrender their own comfort and welfare for future generations.\n\nThey came!

And today only a few ravines and sand-filled ditches mark the place where the village once stood. —LDS Church Historian Andrew Jensen, 1891.\n\nThe remoteness of the area, the water woes, the scanty provisions, the scorched earth, and undoubtedly the scorpions, badgers and snakes offered incentive for settlers to recoil, rethink, and reestablish elsewhere\n\nMesquite had its origins in February 1880, when leaders and selected families of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gathered on the northeast bank of the Virgin River. At that time William Branch was sustained as bishop, and church members were given specific duties related to the cotton enterprise. Because water was critical, the pioneers dug a seven-and-a-half mile irrigation canal. The settlers enjoyed an ample harvest in their first year. But in June of 1882, a flood wreaked havoc demolishing homes and causing the canal to be breached in fifty-eight places. A month later, Bishop Branch dispatched this report: The brethren are steadily working on the canal, 12 of the men are down with chills leaving but 9 at work … 110 degrees in shade and 140 degrees where the men work and filthy water to drink. Families began to leave. By 1883, when Dudley Leavitt’s family moved to Mesquite, the town was deserted. Widespread damage from subsequent storms forced the Leavitts to relocate as well.\n\nAfter two failed attempts to settle Mesquite, a few resolute men, including William Abbott, camped along the abandoned irrigation canal. The year was 1894, and the workers, all in their early twenties, labored to repair the damage. Their rations consisted of an occasional crust of bread, molasses, and warm milk from an old red cow tied to a wagon. In a miraculous way the youthful men prevailed. Water once again flowed, the land was fenced and divided, crops were planted, school classes began, and a voting precinct and post office were established. By 1900, nineteen families called Mesquite home—a humble home, as they lived in wagons, tents, adobe structures and under tarps.\n\nThose who continued on in Mesquite harvested meager crops, were resourceful by necessity, and resolved to be cheerful. In their poverty there arose a noticeable attachment and tenderness toward one another. Soon, life in Mesquite offered more than mere existence. There were magical musical moments: singing, choirs, bands, and dancing. Poetry was written, recitations given, and nearly all tried their hand at acting. Reveling in celebrations, they used any excuse to feast, picnic, and compete in sports.\n\nIn due course, Mesquite became known to the outside world. Mesquite’s grapes and pomegranates took first place at the San Francisco Fair in 1906. Young men served their country, missionaries went forth, trails became roads, and roads became highways. Highways needed bridges, all of which required a united effort at home and input from outside.\n\nEtched in the past—more than the dam, the road, or the bridge—are the builders, the dreamers, those willing to dedicate their lives for a better tomorrow. Tomorrow is here and dreams do come true.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 4030, "filename": "4030.jpeg", "photographer": "Dawn Bowen", "taken": "June 21, 2007", "submitted": "June 28, 2007, by Dawn Bowen of Fredericksburg, Virginia.", "caption": "History of Mesquite Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 604, "aspect": 1.6953642384106}, {"photo_id": 4031, "filename": "4031.jpeg", "photographer": "Dawn Bowen", "taken": "June 21, 2007", "submitted": "June 28, 2007, by Dawn Bowen of Fredericksburg, Virginia.", "caption": "Virgin River at Mesquite", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 685, "aspect": 1.49489051094891}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.06656, 36.80381]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 1466, "number": null, "title": "Mary Jane Leavitt Abbott", "subtitle": "July 16, 1873 – November 30, 1956", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2000, "erected_by": null, "address": "2 E.

She would invite you to eat and then say ‘There’s plenty such as ’tis; … Bless her heart, it was as big as al outdoors when it came to hospitality. —Nellie Hughes Barnett (granddaughter).\n\nMary Jane was Mesquite’s Angel of Mercy. Her satchel, filled to the brim with mustard plasters, castor oil, chaparral tea, and other supplies, sat by her door ready for any emergency. She delivered babies, cared for the sick, and brought hope to the disheartened. When a crisis occurred, Get Aunt Mary Jane ricocheted across the valley and any call for help spurred her into action.\n\nBorn in 1873, at Gunlock, Utah, Mary Jane was the tenth child and second daughter of Dudley and Mary Huntsman Leavitt. A delightful addition to the family, she was high spirited and independent—otorious for expressing her opinion. When she was four years old, the family moved to Bunkerville, Nevada, where she met William Abbott. They later married and moved to Mesquite. She gave birth to thirteen children: Christina, Dorothy, Josepha, Orval, Emily, Oscar, Gussie, Anthon, Deloy, John, Rulon, Claude, and Allen.\n\nShunning personal praise, Mary Jane valued and paid tribute to other women. She called them her sisters, knowing them to be wise, compassionate, and independent. In addition to rearing families, these women preserved food, rendered lard, and made soap and candles over an open fire. They served one another by attending to the physical and emotional needs of the living, comforting the bereaved, and making paper flowers to honor the deceased. Together they were unstoppable! They planted, tended, and picked cotton while babies played in furrows and children lugged cotton sacks. Wagons hauled the cotton to Washington, Utah, where the going price was three-and-a-half cents per pound. In turn, the women received brooms, oil cloths, petticoats and other supplies—a mere pittance for their labor. The bulk of the profit was generously allocated to a women’s fund used for community needs such as cloth for burial clothes and casket linings.\n\nCharity Never Faileth was more than their motto; it was what they lived by. Mesquite thrived because good women performed good works. This was the expression of their faith—etched with indelible ink. This sculpture is in honor of those pioneer women who works are a keepsake from the past and whose faith is a beacon for the future.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 4072, "filename": "4072.jpeg", "photographer": "Dawn Bowen", "taken": "June 21, 2007", "submitted": "June 29, 2007, by Dawn Bowen of Fredericksburg, Virginia.", "caption": "Mary Jane Leavitt Abbott Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 711, "aspect": 1.44022503516174}, {"photo_id": 4073, "filename": "4073.jpeg", "photographer": "Dawn Bowen", "taken": "June 21, 2007", "submitted": "June 29, 2007, by Dawn Bowen of Fredericksburg, Virginia.", "caption": "Mary Jane Leavitt Abbott with baby", "subcaption": "Bronze of Mary Jane Leavitt and William Elias Abbott by Edward Hlavka and LDeane Trueblood.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 685, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6689453125}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.06654, 36.80379]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 1523, "number": "108", "title": "Ruby Valley Pony Express Station", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System and Northeastern Nevada Historical Society", "address": "1515 Idaho Street", "city": "Elko", "subcity": null, "county": "Elko County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Idaho Street, on the right when traveling west.

Lee and others in 1864. Poor in resources but rich in people, Panaca has changed but slowly down through the years. Although mining at nearby Bullionville and Pioche has had its effect, Panaca remains an agricultural community. \n\nThe post office was established in 1867, moved to Bullionville in 1874, and returned to “Panaker” in 1879. During the 1870’s coke ovens produced charcoal here for the smelters at Bullionville. \n\nOriginally located in Washington Country, Utah, Panaca became a portion of Nevada by an act of Congress, dated May 5, 1866. As the boundary was not then surveyed, a dispute arose over taxes levied by Lincoln County, Nevada. Only after a long period of bitter litigation was the matter settled in favor of the Panaca citizenry on December 4, 1971.  \n\nThere are those who lived and died in this community where they were born; others became world travelers. In their unspectacular way, many helped create the great pioneer story. \n\nState Historic Marker No. 39 \nNevada State Park System \nLincoln County Area Development Committee \nNSP 5-5-69", "photos": [{"photo_id": 46412, "filename": "46412.jpeg", "photographer": "Karen Key", "taken": "November 24, 2008", "submitted": "December 10, 2008, by Karen Key of Sacramento, California.", "caption": "Panaca Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 46413, "filename": "46413.jpeg", "photographer": "Karen Key", "taken": "November 24, 2008", "submitted": "December 10, 2008, by Karen Key of Sacramento, California.", "caption": "Panaca Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.38806, 37.79]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 14435, "number": "8", "title": "Austin", "subtitle": "1864 — 1964", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1975, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System", "address": null, "city": "Austin", "subcity": null, "county": "Lander County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Highway 50, on the right when traveling east.

The most famous of these early towns was Hamilton, but there were others adjacent, such as Eberhardt, Treasure City and Sherman Town. These communities, now all ghost towns, lay in a cluster 11 miles south of this point. \n\nHamilton, and its nearby cities, were established as a result of large-scale silver discoveries in 1868. Experiencing one of the most intense, but shortest lived, silver stampedes ever recorded, the years 1868-1869 saw some 10,000 people establish themselves in huts and caves on Treasure Hill at Mount Hamilton, at an elevation of from 8,000 to 10,500 feet above sea level. \n\nThe city was incorporated in 1869, and became the first county seat of White Pine County that same year, and was disincorporated in 1875. In this brief span of time, a full-sized town came into bloom with a main street and all the usual businesses. A fine brick courthouse was constructed in 1870. \n\nOn June 27, 1873, the main portion of the town was destroyed by fire. The town never fully recovered. In 1885, another fire caused the removal of the White Pine county seat to Ely. \n\nState Historical Marker No. 53 \nNevada State Park System \nWhite Pine Public Museum, Inc. \n\n7-6-69", "photos": [{"photo_id": 47721, "filename": "47721.jpeg", "photographer": "Karen Key", "taken": "November 23, 2008", "submitted": "December 25, 2008, by Karen Key of Sacramento, California.", "caption": "Hamilton Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 47722, "filename": "47722.jpeg", "photographer": "Karen Key", "taken": "November 23, 2008", "submitted": "December 25, 2008, by Karen Key of Sacramento, California.", "caption": "Hamilton Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258336, "filename": "258336.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 6, 2013", "submitted": "October 22, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Hamilton Marker", "subcaption": "View west from marker on US-50.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.39444, 39.35361]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 15835, "number": null, "title": "Farmer’s Telephone Company", "subtitle": "1225 Eddy Street", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "U.S. Forest Service, Department of Agriculture", "address": "1225 Eddy Street", "city": "Gardnerville", "subcity": null, "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Eddy Street, 0.1 miles U.S. 395, on the left when traveling west.

Carson, depicted here tracking his way through the mountains east of this location, was considered one of the best mountain men of the day. His name is still synonymous with the wide open spaces and lore of the American West, an image we still cherish as part of our freedom and heritage. It is the spirit and the love of the West that we honor with this statue.\n\nCarson City takes its name from the Carson River which Fremont named to honor Kit Carson.

The original claim was just over 900 feet of the Comstock Lode between the Best & Belcher and the Savage mines. Both men later sold their interest in the mine in the Fall of 1859. Curry relocated to Carson City where he became a major player in the town's growth and is considered the father of Carson City.\n\nBuilt in 1860, the Gould and Curry mining office also provided housing for the mine superintendent. This three story brick building was equipped with a 500-gallon, gravity-flow water tank that was used for daily water consumption. The house was first occupied by mine superintendent George Hearst. Hearst's stay in Virginia City was of short duration as he pursued other mining interests out of state, but Hearst's fortune began in this building in 1860. Bonanza King John Mackay moved into the superintendents quarters after his home at the corner of Taylor and Howard was destroyed in the great fire of 1875. Although married, Mackay lived the life of a bachelor, as his wife Mary Louise resided in Paris and London for more than two decades.\n\nShe was a very popular lady and did not feel her place was on the Comstock. She did not like living here and chose, instead, to live in Europe.\n\nMackay relocated to the International Hotel up on C Street at Union in 1877, when it reopened after the great fire. Total production from the Gould and Curry Mine from 1860 to 1881 was $15.6 million dollars, making it a major producer on the Comstock.\n\nNow known as the Mackay Mansion it has served as a museum and tour of the offices for many years.\nThis marker sponsored by Marshall Earth Resources, Hugh Roy Marshall, Virginia City, Nevada 2009", "photos": [{"photo_id": 73708, "filename": "73708.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 13, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "Gould & Curry Offices Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 73709, "filename": "73709.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 13, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "Gould & Curry Offices - Mackay Mansion", "subcaption": "This marker is located on the far left.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 73710, "filename": "73710.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 13, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "John Mackay", "subcaption": "Close-Up of Photo on Marker", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 622, "height": 718, "aspect": 0.866295264623956}, {"photo_id": 107952, "filename": "107952.jpeg", "photographer": "Walt Mulcahy, Photographer, Published by The Old Lamp Post, Virginia City", "taken": "Circa 1961", "submitted": "May 9, 2010, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "The Gould and Curry Mine Office", "subcaption": "Postcard Discription", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 645, "aspect": 1.58759689922481}, {"photo_id": 73711, "filename": "73711.jpeg", "photographer": "Wikipedia", "taken": "Circa 1874", "submitted": "August 13, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "Bonner Shaft Building - Gould & Curry Mine", "subcaption": "Caption on image", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 780, "height": 456, "aspect": 1.71052631578947}, {"photo_id": 73712, "filename": "73712.jpeg", "photographer": "Robert N.

The town was divided into “wards” for political and fire purposes. Built to honor the nation’s centennial, the majestic four-story building could accommodate over 1000 students, which helped alleviate the serious overcrowding in the eleven other public schools. The new school boasted state-of-the-art heating, ventilation, sanitation systems, curriculum, and teaching practices such as team-teaching.\n\nFollow Their Footsteps\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the other eleven schools were no longer standing and less than 200 students attended the school. The building was in need of repair, and it seemed to be an obsolete relic from another era. A new brick school was built with New Deal funding and the Fourth Ward closed its doors in 1936.\n\nAbandoned to the elements for fifty years, state, federal and private grants rescued the structure and the community reopened the building in 1986 as a museum. As the last school standing of its type, hundreds of thousands of visitors ranging from school groups to foreign tourists have explored this authentically preserved time capsule and exhibits. The Fourth Ward School has become a community cultural center, archives and research center, and a place to connect to people and their stories of the Old West.\n\nExplore Their Stories", "photos": [{"photo_id": 74898, "filename": "74898.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 23, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "The Fourth Ward School Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 483, "aspect": 2.12008281573499}, {"photo_id": 74899, "filename": "74899.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 23, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "The Fourth Ward School Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 74900, "filename": "74900.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 23, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "Close-Up of Artwork on Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 616, "aspect": 1.66233766233766}, {"photo_id": 74901, "filename": "74901.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 9, 2009", "submitted": "August 23, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "The Fourth Ward School", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 75665, "filename": "75665.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 25, 2009", "submitted": "August 31, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "The Fourth Ward School and Chollar Mansion", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.65244, 39.30301]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 21892, "number": "117", "title": "Kingsbury Grade", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Parks System and Carson Valley Historical Society", "address": "1734 Foothill Road", "city": "Gardnerville", "subcity": null, "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of Foothill Road (Nevada Route 206) and Old Kingsbury Grade Road, on the right when traveling south on Foothill Road.

Maguire fell on hard times and sold the opera house to John Piper in 1867. That building burned in the Great Fire of 1875. Piper then rebuilt the second opera house here behind his Corner Saloon, and re-opened on January 28, 1878. Tragedy struck once again when an early morning fire on March 13, 1883, reduced the opera house to a heap of smoldering ruins. Allegedly John Piper, himself, left a cigar burning in his upstairs apartment after closing a show. Piper rebuilt once again and opened the third Opera House on March 6, 1885, this is the building that stands before you today. In addition to hosting the finest entertainment acts in America, Piper’s also served as a venue for political rallies, dances, graduation parties and a host of other civic events. Shakespeare was popular at Piper’s along with orators, poets, and minstrel shows. John Piper arrived in Virginia City in 1860, and opened the Old Corner Wines, Liquors & Co., on this site. He was involved early on in Storey County politics and was elected to the city council in 1865, and took over the mayoral seat the following year. He also served as Storey County Commissioner and was elected state Senator from Storey County in 1875 and 1877. John Piper’s political contributions to Virginia City are all but forgotten today, overshadowed by his three decades of ownership of the famed opera house. John Piper died in San Francisco on January 3, 1897 at age 63.\n\nAt left, Piper’s Opera House during the 1920’s.

The prior courthouse erected on this site was destroyed in the Great Fire of October 26, 1875, that also burned many of Virginia City’s early documents. Storey County hired the architectural firm of Kenitzer and Raum of San Francisco to design the replacement. Work began in 1876 by contractor Peter Burke, and was finished in 1877 at a cost of $117,000.00. The courthouse also served as headquarters for the Storey County Sheriff’s Office until 1992 when a new facility was built on State Route 341, about a ¼ mile from this site. This building is one of two nineteenth century courthouses in Nevada still serving county government. It currently houses the Clerk Treasurer, Assessor, Comptroller, Recorder, County Manager and the County Commissioners.\n\nThe Statue of Justice perched on the second-floor alcove is the only one to grace the exterior of a Nevada building, and has been the source of much controversy. The seven foot zinc figure was manufactured in New York and arrived in Virginia City in 1877 at a cost of only $236.00. Over the years a legend has evolved that she was one of only a few created not blindfolded. Research has proven that about 20 such models exist in the country. Perhaps this one was chosen by residents to make sure that justice would always see that justice prevailed on the Comstock.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 75402, "filename": "75402.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 24, 2009", "submitted": "August 29, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "Storey County Courthouse Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 835, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.8154296875}, {"photo_id": 75403, "filename": "75403.jpeg", "photographer": "Syd Whittle", "taken": "August 24, 2009", "submitted": "August 29, 2009, by Syd Whittle of Mesa, Arizona.", "caption": "Storey County Courthouse", "subcaption": "Marker is located to the left of the entrance steps.

Savage, the original Savage claim consisted of 1,800 feet along the Comstock Lode. In 1865, the company built a mill in Washoe Valley to process ore. Captain Sam Curtis and Charles Bonner became superintendents of the Savage in the mines’ early years. The Savage went into decline at the end of 1865, but became a major producer the following three years when rich ore was struck at the 600 foot level. In 1876, the Savage hit water at the 2,200 foot level and remained flooded for three years. Assessments of nearly $500,00 a year for pumping proved to be costly, and the great production years of the Savage came to an end. Total production from 1863 to 1909 was just over $18 million. On July 8, 1878, the Savage had the distinction of being the first mine on the Comstock to connect to the Sutro Tunnel. The Savage mansion and mine office also played host to ex-president Ulysses S. Grant on his visit to Virginia City on October 27, 1879.\n\n[A Second Marker – Plaque Mounted to the Right of the Steps]\n\nSavage Mansion (c. 1861)\nThis elegant mansion, designed in a French Second Empire style, served as a residence for the superintendent, as well as a mine office for the Savage Mining Company.

The Combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the Comstock, reaching a depth of 3,250 feet. Low grade ore was found at this level, but proved to be of little value. The Combination was plagued by flooding in the mid-1880’s and the two Cornish pumps lifting over 5 million gallons of water a day could not handle the incoming water. Another problem was the stifling heat of 130 degrees due to geothermal forces that often doubled over miners with stomach cramps. The Combination became cost prohibitive and in October, 1886 the pumps were shut down. Within 36 hours water rose to the 2,400 foot level, filling the lower workings of the Chollor-Potosi, Hale & Norcross and the Savage mines. Assessments on the Combination eventually reached $7 million with virtually no return to the owners.

These resources have transformed the southwest into production farmland and thriving communities. The dam was originally built to protect farmland in southern California from flooding by the Colorado River. The Bureau of Reclamation planned the project and designed the dam. Engineering geologists played an important role by surveying the Colorado River for potential dam sites, conducting subsurface investigations, and mapping foundation conditions during construction.\n\nHoover Dam has long been recognized nationally and internationally as one of the world's greatest engineering and construction achievements. Built of 3.23 million cubic yards of concrete, the dam is 726 feet high, 660 feet thick at the base, and 1,244 feet long at the crest. It was the highest dam in the world from 1935 to 1967 and the largest hydroelectric plant in the world from 1936 to 1949. Lake Mead continues to be the largest man-made reservoir in North America. Built during the Great Depression, over 5,000 workers from virtually every state in the nation joined forces to complete Hoover Dam in less than 5 years. It was a symbol of national pride.\n\nWater and power from Hoover Dam and Lake Mead have provided vital benefits to the southwest and the nation. Water from Lake Mead irrigates farmland in southern California and southwestern Arizona. Fruit and vegetables grown in this area are consumed across the country year round. Lake Mead supplies municipal water to Las Vegas, Phoenix, and 33 communities in the Los Angeles area. Hoover Dam generates 4 billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough for 1.3 million people. This power is renewable and does not produce air pollution or toxic water. Income from the sale of electricity pays all to operating costs of the dam.\n\nLake Mead was established as the country's first national recreation area in 1964. It is the fifth most visited park in the National Park system. Nine million people a year come to Lake Mead for boating, fishing, swimming, camping, hiking, and picnicking. The lake covers 247 square mile and has 700 miles of shoreline. The recreation area covers 1.5 million acres and serves as a protected home for desert wildlife such as bighorn sheep, coyotes, jack rabbits, and desert tortoises.\n\nEnvironmental impacts from construction of Hoover Dam have become apparent over the years. The Federal government and states of Nevada, Arizona, and California have initiated an innovative, 50-year program to protect fish and wildlife and restore habitats along the river from Lake Mead to the U.S.-Mexico border. Two species of native fish now endangered in the Lower Colorado River Basin are being grown for release into Lake Mead and other lower Colorado River areas.

Others purchased in 1860, carried salt, ore and supplies through central Nevada.\n\nCareless treatment, domestic stock incompatibility and new transportation methods ended use of camels.

Destroyed by the winds of the following winter, this church was replaced in 1864 when the Rev. Patrick Manogue (1831-95) erected a new church a block away from here. The present church, originally built in 1868, was seriously damaged in the Great Fire of 1875 but rebuilt in 1876.

Originally water was free for the taking but as demand increased the supply became valuable. Two companies were formed to collect and distribute water. The Virginia Water Company and the Gold Hill Water Company. The two organizations were consolidated May 12, 1862, as the Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company with an enlarged capital of $250,000. The first water mains were wooden flumes. In August 1863, riveted iron supply pipes were laid around the community. In 1871, the company reorganized with W.S. Hobart, John Mackay, James Fair, James Flood and W.S. O'Brien as directors. A plan was executed to bring water from the Hobart Creek and Marlette Reservoir area 1,500 feet above Lake tahoe on the west side of Washoe Valley. A pipe line was laid from this point down to the Washoe Valley and back up the other side to Virginia City in a reverse siphon process. This required a pipe line 7 miles long and 11.5 inches in diameter. The water pressure exceeded 200psi. The pipeline was completed July 25, 1873. The pipeline transported two million gallons a day. By 1887, two more pipelines had been laid to supply water to the Comstock. The Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company was purchased by Storey County over 100 years later. This water systems has served the drinking and fire fighting needs since 1861. This building served as the Water Company office into the 1980s. \nThis marker sponsored by the Russ and Pam Brandon family, Virginia City, Nevada, 2009", "photos": [{"photo_id": 128653, "filename": "128653.jpeg", "photographer": "Andrew Ruppenstein", "taken": "September 11, 2010", "submitted": "September 20, 2010, by Andrew Ruppenstein of Lamorinda, California.", "caption": "Virginia & Gold Hill Water Company Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 854, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.833984375}, {"photo_id": 128657, "filename": "128657.jpeg", "photographer": "C.

En route to Los Angeles from Santa Fe, trader Antonio Armijo, 60 men and 100 mules camped here on January 11, 1830. The spring was named for miner Joe Good, who watered cattle here in the 1860's.\n\nThe spring was artesian, promising adequate water for a mill and town if wells were drilled. Increasing mining activity in the 1860's and 1870's led to the formation of the Yellow Pine Mining District in 1882. In 1886 A.G. Campbell, Jonas Taylor and William Smith built the first permanent structure, a stone building still standing north of State Route 161. The 1893 discovery of the Keystone gold deposit brought many prospectors to the area. During the same time Sam Yount was operating a store in the stone building which stands south of State Route 161. On April 6, 1899 mail service was established and the Post Office changed the town's name to Goodsprings.\n\n\nThe Yellow Pine Mining Company, established in 1901, soon became the biggest lead and zinc mine in Nevada. In 1911 the mine built a narrow-gauge railroad connecting the mine to the mill in Goodsprings, four miles away, and continuing seven miles to the main line at Jean. The demand for minerals during WWI and the new railroad connection fueled Goodsprings' biggest growth, with the population reaching over 800. By 1917 when America entered the war, the town had a new expanded school and its own newspaper. George Fayle built a first-class hotel, general store, bar and café'. Fayle served as a County Commissioner from 1912 until his death during the 1918 flu epidemic. Goodsprings' economic decline began after WWI but mining activity never stopped and the mining claims still produce a wide variety of minerals.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 141641, "filename": "141641.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "December 28, 2010", "submitted": "January 5, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Good's Spring Marker", "subcaption": "Click on photo to view photos and captions.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 732, "aspect": 1.39890710382514}, {"photo_id": 141642, "filename": "141642.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "December 28, 2010", "submitted": "January 5, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Good's Spring Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 141643, "filename": "141643.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "December 28, 2010", "submitted": "January 5, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo of school on Good's Spring Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 904, "aspect": 1.13274336283186}, {"photo_id": 141644, "filename": "141644.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "December 28, 2010", "submitted": "January 5, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Goodsprings School (today)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 141645, "filename": "141645.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "December 28, 2010", "submitted": "January 5, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo of Campbell Cabin on Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 620, "aspect": 1.65161290322581}, {"photo_id": 141646, "filename": "141646.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "December 28, 2010", "submitted": "January 5, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Campbell Stone Cabin (today)", "subcaption": "Campbell's Stone Cabin is located about 100 yards north of the Good's Spring Marker, on the north side of Spring Street.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.43524, 35.83154]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 39471, "number": "102", "title": "Goodsprings Mining District 1856 - 1957", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1970, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System and Southern Nevada Historical Society", "address": null, "city": "Goodsprings", "subcity": null, "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Spring Street, 0.1 miles west of Vegas Street, on the left when traveling west.

It was then that his little brother Mastamho took charge of the world of the people. There were only people then, no animals, birds or fish. Mastamho had to teach the people everything about living, for they knew nothing, not even that they were hungry, thirsty or cold.\n\nHe drove a willow stick into the ground and drew out the water that became the Colorado River, and with the river came fish and ducks. Mastamho made the mountains on both sides of the river using the mud of its banks. He planted seeds of melon, corn, pumpkin and beans in the overflow, so the people would have food to eat.\n\nHe taught them to build fire when they were cold, and a shade from the sun when they were hot. He showed them how to count. He taught them about the four directions, about the food they grew, and he showed them how to make pottery vessels in which they could cook and store the food. He made the animals and insects and birds, and he gave the people the names for all things.\n\nMastamho gave the people the river and everything along the river. Whatever grew there was theirs, as he said, and they were the Aha Macave, the Mojave, the people who live along the water.\n\nFor the Aha Macave, the river was the center of existence. They practiced a dry farming method, relying on the regular overflow of the Colorado River to irrigate crops planted along the banks. They supplemented this with wild seeds and roots, especially mesquite beans, game and fish taken from the river with traps and nets.>br>\n\nThe Mojave could be a fierce people, willing to protect their land and traveling to the Pacific Coast as proficient traders, where they exchanged with coastal tribes their surplus crops for goods they desired and valued, such as shells.\n\nAnd back along the banks of the river, they made pottery from sedimentary clay and crushed sandstone, creating cooking utensils and pottery dolls for the children.\n\nThe art of tatooing was important to the Mojave. They tattooed their faces with lines and dots - a cosmetic, fashionable practice.\n\nAnd at death, the Mojaves used cremation to enter the spirit world. The property and belongings of the deceased were placed on a funeral pyres along with the body, to accompany the spirit. Mourners often contributed their own valuable as a showing of love. The names of the dead were never again spoken.\n\n\nAha Macave and Then the White Man Came\n\n\nSometimes friendly, sometimes deadly. That described the early contact between the Mojave and the white man.\n\nThe search for fortune was what brought the white man to the land of the Mojave. A 1604 expedition in search of silver led New Mexico Governor Don Juan Onate through Mojave territory, but it wasn't until December 1775 that Fray Francisco Garces became the first white man to meet the Mojave. His writings reveal the Mojave as friendly. He comments that \"The female sex is the most comely along the river, the males very healthy and robust.\" The men walked naked, the women wore rabbit and beaver skin capes.

Subsequent encounters also ended in violence.\n\nIn 1911, by Executive Order, the Fort Mojaves were granted a reservation consisting of the old military reserve, areas called the Hay and Wood Reserves on the California and Nevada side of the Colorado River, and adjacent checkerboard land on the Arizona side, a total of 32,000 acres. The checkerboard arrangement came about because the government gave the railroad every other section of land.\n\nThe Boarding School closed in 1931, and children began attending public school in Needles.\n\nThe traditional leadership structure was changed forever in 1957 with the approval of the Fort Mojave Tribal Constitution, and with it the creation of a seven member Tribal Council.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 143507, "filename": "143507.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 26, 2011", "submitted": "February 1, 2011.", "caption": "History of the Fort Mojave Tribe Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 700, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.68359375}, {"photo_id": 143513, "filename": "143513.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 26, 2011", "submitted": "February 1, 2011.", "caption": "Fort Mojave Tribe Marker Viewed Toward the West", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 143508, "filename": "143508.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 26, 2011", "submitted": "February 1, 2011.", "caption": "History of the Fort Mojave Tribe Marker", "subcaption": "Beatrice Jacobo; wife, mother, Tribal Environmental Program Technician, former Tribal Council member, traditionalist cultivated by her elders, youth motivator, and generally impressive human being stands beside the marker.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 301129, "filename": "301129.jpeg", "photographer": "Sandie Kirchner", "taken": "February 19, 2015", "submitted": "February 24, 2015, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "History of the Fort Mojave Tribe Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 720, "height": 960, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 143510, "filename": "143510.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 26, 2011", "submitted": "February 1, 2011.", "caption": "Looking North from the Fort Mojave Tribe Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 143511, "filename": "143511.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 26, 2011", "submitted": "February 1, 2011.", "caption": "Looking East of the Fort Mojave Tribe Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 143512, "filename": "143512.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 26, 2011", "submitted": "February 1, 2011.", "caption": "Looking South from the Fort Mojave Tribe Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.64254, 35.01574]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 40485, "number": null, "title": "Engineering Marvels on the Comstock", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2010, "erected_by": "Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, Historic Fourth Ward School Foundation, The Comstock Historic District Commission, Ron James Storey Count", "address": null, "city": "Virginia City", "subcity": null, "county": "Storey County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on 537 South \"C\" Street, on the right when traveling north.

Arriving from places as diverse as the Germanies, Poland, Russia, and North America, Jewish immigrants with engineering backgrounds, entrepreneurial spirit, and creativity, they were foremost in developing innovative technological marvels. The Comstock Lode became the \"richest place on earth\" largely thanks to their remarkable contribution.\n\nAs the miners followed the Comstock Lode deeper into the ground, traditional methods of supporting the underground tunnels did not work. In 1860, the Ophir Mining Company hired Philipp Deidesheimer(1832-1916), a young German Jewish mining engineer working in the\nCalifornia gold mines, to solve the problem of the large, deep and unstable underground diggings. He invented a system of \"cubes\" (similar to a honeycomb structure) using heavy timbers or square set timbering, that enabled skilled miners to open three-dimensional underground cavities of any size. Deidesheimer never secured a patent on his significant and world acclaimed, widely used mining innovation. He was employed as a mine superintendent and invested in mines in Virginia City and California with varied success.\n\nAlthough square set timbering allowed miners to go deeper underground, they encountered another problem - water. Water, mostly at scalding temperatures and not potable, seeped from underground sources and flooded the shafts. Huge steam driven pumps (Cornish pumps) and short-term drainage tunnels were used to rid the mines of the water, but these were only temporary solutions. Adolph Sutro (1830-1898) proposed a massive drainage tunnel that could also be used to transport ore and miners. He created the Sutro Tunnel Company in 1865 with a legislative charter and secured financing for a 3.88 mile long adit from the Carson River valley to the Comstock. In 1869, Sutro swing the first pick for construction of the tunnel, a town, and a mill at the\nopening of the adit. Tunnel construction was stalled politically for several years but finally completed in 1878 to drain at the 1,640 foot level. Although collapsed, the Sutro Tunnel still drains some water from the mines.\n\nMeanwhile above ground, the growing population was struggling to find safe drinking water. In 1871, the Virginia and Gold Hill Water Company devised plans to bring water from the Sierra Nevada range, thirty miles\nto the west with elevation differences of 2,000 feet at both ends. The Water Company's directors hired Herman Schussler (1842-1919), a civil engineer who had completed a smaller but similar system in California. Schussler designed an engineering feat of flumes, tunnels,tanks, and reservoirs in the Sierra to feed a pipeline that dropped into the Washoe Valley and rose back to the Virginia Range above the Comstock. The system required the development of an inverted siphon to carry the water uphill without pumps and a heavy gauge pipe to withstand the pressure. The system completed in 1873 still supplies water to the the Comstock.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 145372, "filename": "145372.jpeg", "photographer": "Jerry Klinger", "taken": "Circa  May 15, 2010", "submitted": "February 24, 2011, by Jerry Klinger of Boynton Beach, Florida.", "caption": "Engineering Marvels on the Comstock Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 605, "aspect": 1.69256198347107}, {"photo_id": 145395, "filename": "145395.jpeg", "photographer": "Jerry Klinger", "taken": "May 15, 2010", "submitted": "February 24, 2011, by Jerry Klinger of Boynton Beach, Florida.", "caption": "Close-Up of Marker Text", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 862, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.841796875}, {"photo_id": 145396, "filename": "145396.jpeg", "photographer": "Jerry Klinger", "taken": "May 15, 2010", "submitted": "February 24, 2011, by Jerry Klinger of Boynton Beach, Florida.", "caption": "Close-Up of Marker Text", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 867, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.8466796875}, {"photo_id": 380792, "filename": "380792.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 30, 2014", "submitted": "April 19, 2017, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Engineering Marvels on the Comstock Marker", "subcaption": "This marker is located on the far right.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 145458, "filename": "145458.jpeg", "photographer": "Wikipedia", "taken": "Circa 1880s", "submitted": "February 25, 2011.", "caption": "Entrance to the Sutro Tunnel", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 220, "height": 165, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 145457, "filename": "145457.jpeg", "photographer": "Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division", "taken": null, "submitted": "February 25, 2011.", "caption": "Entrance to the Sutro Tunnel", "subcaption": "Historic American Buildings Survey", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 455, "aspect": 1.40659340659341}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.65195, 39.3031]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 41082, "number": "199", "title": "Camels in Dayton", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System and the Dayton Historical Society", "address": "200 Pike Street", "city": "Dayton", "subcity": null, "county": "Lyon County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Pike Street near 2nd Avenue.

In April 1963 Chandler A. Laughlin III established a kind of tribal, family identity among approximately fifty people who attended a traditional, all night Native American peyote ceremony in a rural setting. This ceremony combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the Red Dog Saloon.\nDuring the summer of 1965, Laughlin recruited much of the original talent that led to a unique amalgam of traditional folk music and the developing psychedelic rock scene. He and his cohorts created what became known as “The Red Dog Experience,” featuring previously unknown musical acts – Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Charlatans, The Grateful Dead and others – who played in the completely refurbished, intimate setting of Virginia City’s Red Dog Saloon. There was no clear delineation between “performers” and “audience” in “The Red Dog Experience.” During which music, psychedelic experimentation, a unique sense of personal style and Bill Ham’s first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community. Laughlin and George Hunter of the Charlatans were true “proto-hippies,” with their long hair, boots and outrageous clothing of distinctly American (and Native American) heritage.\nLSD manufacturer Owsley Stanley lived in Berkeley during 1965 and provided much of the LSD that became a seminal part of the “Red Dog Experience,” the early evolution of psychedelic rock and budding hippie culture. At the Red Dog Saloon, The Charlatans were the first psychedelic rock band to play live (albeit unintentionally) loaded on LSD.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 165881, "filename": "165881.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Red Dog Saloon Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 165885, "filename": "165885.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Red Dog Saloon", "subcaption": "Marker in the window on the left.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 165886, "filename": "165886.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Red Dog Saloon", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 165887, "filename": "165887.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 4, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Red Dog Saloon", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 393047, "filename": "393047.jpeg", "photographer": "Wikipedia", "taken": "1965", "submitted": "August 5, 2017, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Charlatans in front of the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 299, "height": 333, "aspect": 0.897897897897898}, {"photo_id": 393048, "filename": "393048.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "June 7, 2017", "submitted": "August 5, 2017, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "\"The Seed,\" The Amazing Charlatans, 1965", "subcaption": " \"The lineage of the San Francisco psychedelic rock poster is popularly traced back to \"The Seed,\" the 1965 poster designed by the Charlatans autoharpist George Hunter and keyboardist Michael Ferguson to announce the San Francisco band's folk-rock residency (at the Red Dog Saloon) in Virginia City.\"  De Young Museum, \"The Summer of Love\" exhibit", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 393049, "filename": "393049.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "June 7, 2017", "submitted": "August 5, 2017, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "\"Kinetic Light Painting\" by Bill Ham", "subcaption": "\"...created by the light show artist Bill Ham...

In 1868, a fierce stock battle was waged for ownership over this property. At the time, the mine was thought to be barren and was in the hands of William Sharon and the Bank of California (Wm. Ralston). Local miners John Mackay and James Fair were convinced the mine had been poorly managed, but would produce good ore if properly worked. The two formed an alliance with former San Francisco saloon owners James Flood and William O’Brien, and with $50,000 of borrowed money secretly began buying Hale & Norcross stock. Sharon, known as the “King of the Comstock” was rarely bested in mining matters, but was caught napping when the stock raid took place. At the annual stockholders meeting on March 10, 1869, the four men now known as the Bonanza Firm, holding a majority of the stock elected themselves trustees of the Hale & Norcross Company. The gamble had paid off and the four netted over $500,000 from this deal alone.\n\nTheir biggest victory however, came four years later with the discovery of the Big Bonanza in 1873. In 1875, the Hale & Norcross in conjunction with the Savage and Chollar-Potosi mines sank a large four compartment shaft known as the Combination Shaft, to explore the Comstock Lode at a greater depth, but the operation proved to be of little value. Today remnants of the Combination Shaft can be seen to the east of Virginia City. Total production from the Hale & Norcross from the years of 1875 to 1826 yielded $10.1 million ($17,600,000.00 in today’s dollars.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 167025, "filename": "167025.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Hale & Norcross Mining Co.

Construction of the shafts consisted of 12 inch timbers installed every 5 ft. and supported by vertical posts the same size. The cribbing was then covered on the outside by 4 inch planks. Wooden or metal guides were then installed down each side to the compartments to hold, and keep, the platform cages in place as they rode up and down the shafts. Construction costs for the Bonner Shaft averaged $109.00 a foot, which included materials used in its operation. The Bonner’s housing works survived the great fire of 1875, but with the decline of mining its machinery was later sold, and the building was eventually scrapped. In October 1992, a sinkhole measuring 40 feet in width and 60 feet in depth opened up at the site caused by an underground flowing water leak and rotting timbers. The Bonner Shaft cave in was filled with a plug consisting of steel and concrete and a cost to Storey County of $250,000, and has been trouble free ever since.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 167026, "filename": "167026.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Bonner Shaft of the Gould & Curry Mine Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 167027, "filename": "167027.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Bonner Shaft of the Gould & Curry Mine Marker", "subcaption": "Mounted on the pole under the Speed Limit Sign.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167028, "filename": "167028.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": "[Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167029, "filename": "167029.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Foundation of the Bonner Shaft Hoist Works.", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.64965, 39.30857]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 45904, "number": "17", "title": "The Storey County Jail", "subtitle": "Comstock Historical Maker No. 17", "subsubtitle": "Courthouse South B Street, Virginia City, NV", "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Bruce and Linda Larson and the Comstock Historical Society", "address": null, "city": "Virginia City", "subcity": null, "county": "Storey County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on North B Street.

Women were housed on the second level and men on the first floor until 1963, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that males and females could not occupy the same facility without being physically separated. There was heavy wire mesh strung between the posts of the second level to prevent falls and mingling of inmates.\n\nThe jail operated continuously from 1877 until September of 1986, when the county’s insurance carrier decided it was unwise to operate it with only one exit in the event of fire. Inmates were housed at the Carson City Sheriff’s Jail, for a fee, until the current jail was opened in 1992 on the outskirts of town on the “Truck Route – SR341”.\n\nThe walls of the jail were covered in boiler plate, after a successful escape in 1897 by an alleged murderer who had worked on the building as a bricklayer. “Red Mike” Langan knew the walls had not been properly filled with rubble material as required, and was able to dig his way out and escape. The county went to great expense to see that this did not happen again.\n\nThe doors of the jail were built C.F. Nutting of San Francisco, the same company that supplied all the vaults in the rest of the courthouse. The stone floors are made of “Kate’s Peak Andesite,” a very dense and heavy granite which was quarried from the hills a short distance to the east of Virginia City.\nThis marker sponsored by Bruce & Linda Larson of Virginia City, Nevada who both retired from the Storey County Sheriff’s Office and worked in this jail.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 167031, "filename": "167031.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 23, 2011", "submitted": "August 9, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Storey County Jail Marker", "subcaption": "Click on photo to view close-up of photos displayed on marker.

Beyond the dump site is a ridge extending to your left. The trail winds along this ridge for two miles through Pinyon Juniper forest to a quarry site before looping back. The four-mile round trip trail offers spectacular desert vistas as well as exploration of the flora, fauna and scattered traces of the mining that shaped the cultural and physical landscapes of the Comstock. Pleas take a self-guided tour brochure and read about the points of interest along the way. Look for the air shaft from Adolph Sutro’s tunnel along the way! Be careful, watch your children and pets. Allow 2 ½ hours for this hike. Enjoy!\n\nTunneling for Treasure\nIn the early 1860s, Adolph Sutro found an ingenious way to dominate Comstock mining. He proposed a tunnel nearly four miles long that would provide easy access to deep mines, allow for needed ventilation, and drain the shafts of water. It would also transfer miners and ore for a small fee.\n\nSutro’s tunnel proved almost worthless because of various delays. By 1878, insiders recognized that the mines had descended far below the tunnel intersection point. Sutro sold his stocks before this was public knowledge. He invested that fortune in San Francisco real estate and an electric rail line to reach his giant family-oriented swimming pools and Cliff House at the ocean. He was later elected San Francisco’s mayor.\n\nThe Story of the Comstock begins a decade before Sutro’s arrival...\n\n\nA Miner’s Life\nThe prospectors who came to the eastern slope of the Sierra from the California Gold County in the 1850’s brought their meager belongings, crude tents for shelter, and a technology better suited to place (surface) mining.\nIllustrations of the Gold Rush era depict tranquil settings where prospectors pan for gold, crush their mineral finds with arrastras, and use rockers or longtoms to separate valuable minerals from worthless dirt. Miners soon discovered that Comstock riches lay deep underground calling for a new technology.\n\n\nLost Opportunities\nAfter the 1859 mineral discovery, several miners shared the gold and silver emerging from the ground. They made high wages, but when newcomers called “California Rock Sharps” arrived, prospectors including James “Old Virginny” Finney, who named Virginia City, and Henry H.P. “Pancake” Comstock eagerly sold their claims for several thousand dollars each. Later, they cursed themselves for allowing millions of dollars to slip away. Impoverished and regarded as a drunken fool, Finney fell off a horse in 1861 and broke his neck. In 1870, Comstock shot himself, dying in relative obscurity in Montana.\n\n\n[Panel 2]:\n\nEureka! Nevada Style\nLook up at the “V” on the hillside. This is Mount Davidson, nearly 8,000 feet high. People came from all over the world seeking its treasure.\n\nAs news of the gold and silver reached California, fortune hunters from every profession hurried over the Sierra, settling on this side of the mountain. Look around you. Between 1859 and 1880 thousands of people worked on the Comstock – in mines, mills, and supporting industries. Comstock mines yielded roughly $360 million, the equivalent of several billion dollars today. Riches seemed to pour from the earth.\n\nFortunes Found and Lost\nBy 1864, corporations exploited the Comstock, replacing individual miners. William C. Ralston, a California businessman with early Comstock investments, organized the Bank of California to monopolize the district and seize the profits. With the help of the Banks shrewd local agent, William Sharon, the institution controlled critical aspects of the local economy. Its crowning achievement, the Virginia and Truckee (V & T) Railroad, linked Virginia City to the Transcontinental Railroad in 1872. Comstockers quickly dubbed it the “Very Crooked and Terribly Rough Railroad.” Bad investments forced the Bank of California into a downward spiral a few years later.\n\nThe Big Bonanza\nA new set of entrepreneurs eventually took control of the mining district with a new strike in the Consolidated Virginia Mine in 1873. It was dubbed the Big Bonanza.\n\nOne of the world’s largest gold and silver bodies, it was the climax of the rise of two Irish immigrants, John W. Mackay and James G. Fair. They became two of the world’s richest men. According to legend, Mackay arrived in Virginia City with nothing in his pockets. After working in the mines, he made his first fortune through shrewd stock investments and the acquisition of mining claims.\n\nMackay’s reward was over three million dollars in gold and silver. He and Fair formed a partnership with former San Francisco saloon keepers James C. Flood and Willam S. O’Brien, also native sons of Ireland.\n\n\n\n[Panel 3]:\n\nHigh Risks, High Profits\nHigh off to the left, just below the horizon you can see the Comstock cemeteries. There are many more gravesites attesting to the hazards of underground mining – cave-ins, fires, falling equipment and pneumonia, to name a few. Technology and worker unions combined to make the Comstock a safer place to work.\n\nMining for Riches\nIn the early 1860’s, a stock prospectus for the famed Gould & Curry Silver Mining Company boasted lithographs of its cutting edge technology. Comstock mines and mills established industry standards used internationally for the next fifty years.\n\nThe prospectus invited investors to capitalize on the dynamic combination of ingenuity and natural resources, and when gold and silver poured from the mills, prosperity touched thousands of people.\n\nWith a minimum wage of $4 per day for underground work, miners’ salaries were the envy of the industrial world. But it was some mine owners and stockholders who became millionaires. Injury, death and the lack of benefits left many miners’ families destitute.\n\nSquare-set Timbering\nThe extraordinary Comstock Lode exceeded everyone’s wildest expectations by expanding underground into a gold and silver vein up to sixty feet wide. Baffled miners could not imagine how to support the cavern created by excavating such riches. In 1860, the Ophir Mine hired Philipp Deidesheimer, a young German engineer, to solve the problem.\n\nHe developed a wood beam support system known as square-set timbering. It called for modular cubes roughly six feet tall by five feet wide that could expand in every direction to shore up any space. Filling the cubes with waste rock added stability, eliminating the cost of hoisting debris to the surface. This system became the industry standard for the next fifty years.\n\nUnfortunately, the young engineer let a fortune slip through his fingers. Millions of dollars were invested in square-set systems around the world, but Deidesheimer never received a dime as he had neglected to patent his design.\n\n\n[Panel 4]:\n\nA Town That Never Died\nVirginia City never became a ghost town like many other cities hosting mining operations in the 19th Century West. It was a close call, however, during some periods of its existence.\n\nComstock Rebirth\nWhen an immense fire destroyed the heart of Virginia City in late 1875, residents vowed to rebuild on a scale that would show the world that the Comstock was still a land of opportunity with a bright future.\nThroughout 1876, Virginia City was the scene of a construction boom with Victorian architectural designs dotting the landscape. The new Fourth Ward School and International Hotel featured the distinctive Second Empire style, while the Storey County Courthouse conveyed stability with its Italianate facade.\n\nPrivate mansions displayed prosperity as well. Residents in Gold Hill and on the upper streets of Virginia City, including B Street’s “Millionaire’s Row,” chose opulent architectural styles and well-appointed interiors.\n\nFortune’s Clock Was Ticking\nBy the 1880’s the Comstock Lode was depleted. The population of Virginia City and Gold Hill quickly declined as the unemployed lost hope and left to seek better opportunities.\n\nAs the Comstock slumped, small mining operations combed the district, certain they would discover the next Big Bonanza. These “rat hole” mines, evidenced by small mounds of dirt, are scattered by the hundreds around the Comstock’s hills and mountains.\n\nBy the 1930’s, many of Virginia City’s homes, churches and businesses had succumbed to harsh weather, neglect, or fire. Residents closer to town purchased adjoining houses for back taxes. A family would then spend the winter harvesting the house’s wood to feed their stove. By spring, they had a vacant side yard where a home once sheltered people who dreamed of riches, or at least a better life.\n\n\n[Panel 5]:\n\nThe New Comstock\nTelevision, tourism and history combine to make Virginia City an interesting place to live or visit in the 21st Century.\n\nThe television series Bonanza premiered in 1959, honoring the centennial of the first Comstock strike. High ratings inspired millions of tourists to come to the aged mining district. The riches had returned, but in a way unfamiliar to the town.\n\nBonanza kept Virginia City at center stage for fifteen years. Today, the community has learned to rely on careful restoration and interpretation to greet an increasingly sophisticated heritage tourist.\n\nThe federal and state governments, with help from institutions like the Nevada Humanities, have given millions of dollars to preserve this town in honor of the people who lived off the rugged lands of the American West.\n\nPiper’s Opera House, the Fourth Ward School Museum, and the Comstock cemeteries are interesting and safe places to visit because of this funding.\n\nDuring the Comstock’s golden days, Piper’s Opera House in Virginia City was a required stop for famous actors and touring companies making the circuit from the East Coast to San Francisco. Between performances, its grand auditorium served as a community center for the lively town. By the 1930s, the building had fallen into ruin. Today, the restored Piper’s Opera House is a center for fine plays and musical presentations. Piper’s is located on B Street near the center of town.\n\nThe Fourth Ward School was built for a thousand students in 1876. The school was considered “state of the art,” with modern health amenities, curriculum, and furnishings. The school was boarded up for fifty years before it was reopened as a museum in 1986. With diverse programming, a changing gallery, and engaging exhibits, the school is now a community center and a remarkable setting for those wishing to learn more about the Comstock. The school is located on the south end of town on C Street.\n\nThe Comstock cemeteries have been plundered and fallen into disrepair for nearly a century. Today the Comstock Cemetery Foundation is working to restore the land to the earlier vision of the cemetery as a beautiful oasis in the desert landscape and a dignified place to bury loved ones. The cemetery is located on the north end of town behind the RV Park.\n\n\n[Panel 6]:\n\nNatural Resources, Mining and Landscape\n\nLook at the cyclone fence in front of you. In August 1995, the ground disappeared, sinking down more that two thousand feet, almost fifty feet across the old mine shaft. Plugged with old cars thirty years before, the makeshift barrier gave way with time. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nHundreds of miles of shafts and tunnels still exist under this town. Above ground, mining tailings are the only scars that can be seen today. However, the Carson River, ten miles east, has high concentrations of mercury resulting from the processing of Comstock silver at nearby mills. Residents are warned not to eat too many fish from this river.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, hundreds of thousands of trees were chopped down throughout this region. Forests on the east side of the Carson Range eventually disappeared. Spooner Summit, Incline, Glenbrook, and Truckee became key transportation centers for timber and cordwood as logging extended along a fifty-mile path into the Sierras.\n\nCordwood was used for cooking, home heating and fuel for steam-powered generators. Timber was used for railroads, buildings, square-set timbering and flumes for transporting wood and water.\n\nWater was another concern for the miners, either too little of it for drinking or too much of it as miners delved deep into the earth. Scalding water in the mines remained a challenge throughout the mining days despite massive Cornish pumps and Adolph Sutro’s tunnel. For its potable water, Virginia City eventually purchased water held in Hobart Reservoir and Marlette Lake, high in the Carson Range near Lake Tahoe. A clever piping system, working on the reverse siphon principle, brought water down from Hobart into Washoe Valley and over the mountains to the West, the Virginia Range.\n\nThese natural resources and related technology made Comstock mining possible. The gold and silver contributed huge sums of money to the U.S. economy during and after the Civil War. It created thousands of jobs and financed new industries throughout the West.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 167872, "filename": "167872.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker - Panel 1", "subcaption": "[Far left picture caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167873, "filename": "167873.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker, Panel 2", "subcaption": "[Far left picture captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167874, "filename": "167874.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker, Panel 3", "subcaption": "[Far left picture caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167875, "filename": "167875.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker, Panel 4", "subcaption": "[Far left photo caption]", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167876, "filename": "167876.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker, Panel 5", "subcaption": "[Far left picture caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167877, "filename": "167877.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker, Panel 6", "subcaption": "[Far left picture caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 167878, "filename": "167878.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "August 15, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Panel describing the Comstock Trail", "subcaption": "The Comstock Trail is a 4-mile, roundtrip, self-guided tour offering \"historic vistas of the Comstock's past.\"_x000D_\nClick image to enlarge.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 182786, "filename": "182786.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "November 29, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 182787, "filename": "182787.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "November 29, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Comstock Trail and History Kiosk Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.642, 39.30698]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 46380, "number": null, "title": "America's First Transcontinental Highway", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2002, "erected_by": "Nevada-Sierra Chapter, Lincoln Highway Association, Julia C.

Overton, Logandale, and St. Thomas were revived, though St. Thomas, along with the later settlement of Kaolin, was ultimately drowned by the waters of Lake Mead.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 171634, "filename": "171634.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "August 29, 2011", "submitted": "September 11, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Early Settlements in the Moapa Valley Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 731, "aspect": 1.40082079343365}, {"photo_id": 171635, "filename": "171635.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "August 29, 2011", "submitted": "September 11, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Early Settlements in the Moapa Valley Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 171636, "filename": "171636.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "August 29, 2011", "submitted": "September 11, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Early Settlements in the Moapa Valley Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.44347, 36.53881]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 47732, "number": null, "title": "Auction Site", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1980, "erected_by": "The Las Vegas Diamond Jubilee Committee", "address": "2-198 North Main Street", "city": "Las Vegas", "subcity": "Downtown Las Vegas", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of North Main Street and Fremont Street, on the right when traveling south on North Main Street. <font color=red> Reported missing.</font>", "missing": "Confirmed Missing", "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=47732", "description": "On May 15, 1905, in this area, The City of Las Vegas was founded with the auction of lots in Clark's Las Vegas Townsite by San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad and Las Vegas Land & Water Company, predecessors of Union Pacific Railroad and Upland Industries\nCorporation in Nevada.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 174539, "filename": "174539.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "September 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Auction Site Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 174540, "filename": "174540.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "September 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Auction Site Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 174542, "filename": "174542.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "September 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Auction Site Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 174541, "filename": "174541.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "September 30, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Auction Site Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.14645, 36.17187]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 47734, "number": null, "title": "Historic Light Standard", "subtitle": "Historic Site", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1980, "erected_by": "The Las Vegas Diamond Jubilee Committee", "address": null, "city": "Las Vegas", "subcity": "Downtown Las Vegas", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of North Main Street and Fremont Street, on the right when traveling south on North Main Street. <font color=red> Reported missing.</font>", "missing": "Confirmed Missing", "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=47734", "description": "This light standard was placed at the entrance to the Las Vegas Union Pacific Railroad Station in 1937.

The first train depot was built here by the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad in 1905. Senator William A. Clark of Montana, and his brother J. Ross Clark, were the co-founders of this railroad. The brothers eventually sold their interest to the Union Pacific in 1921. The early Mission style depot was replaced in 1940 by a streamline Moderne structure. The depot was demolished in 1970 to make way for the Union Plaza Hotel, which was built in 1971. Passenger train service continued for many years with the depot located inside the hotel. At the head of Fremont Street, the depot building symbolized the railroad's economic, political and social dominance over the town.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 174553, "filename": "174553.jpeg",

From its inception as a railroad town in 1905, the citizens of Las Vegas tolerated gambling as a part of daily life.\n\n\nWhile some games of chance were already legal, Nevada legalized \"wide open\" gambling in 1931, creating legitimacy for the industry. That year, the first local gaming license was issued to Mayme Stocker of the Northern Club, located near First and Fremont. Since 1931, Las Vegas has benefited from the capital investments and the gambling experience of operators from other states, who were attracted here by the unique legal status of gambling. For several decades, Fremont Street was the center of gambling in Las Vegas. Aided by spectacular neon signs, images of \"Glitter Gulch\" established Las Vegas as the worldwide leader of gambling. \n\nSide B:\n\n Helldorado\nAnticipating the end of Hoover Dam construction and the workers that it brought to town, Las Vegas sought other means for economic prosperity. In 1935, led by the Las Vegas \nElks Club, the first Helldorado celebration took place. This event became a four-day celebration, taking place every May. Helldorado featured parades down Fremont Street, rodeos, carnivals, frontier-style clothing, beard-growing contest, and a \"Kangaroo Kourt\". Helldorado created a \"Wild West\" atmosphere for Las Vegas and was one of the very first special events aimed at attracting tourist. Helldorado was made popular in the movies, when the 1946 Roy Rogers film Heldorado premiered. Movie censors insisted Heldorado be spelled with on \"l\". For Las Vegas residents, Helldorado was a source of civic pride and an annual rite of spring. Generations of school children joined the parades and floats, as they enjoyed time off from school. Ending in the mid-1990s, Helldorado was the longest running civic celebration in Las Vegas history.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 174568, "filename": "174568.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner",

", "missing": null, "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=47754", "description": "This is a two sided marker\nSide A:\n\nStanding on Fremont Street today, it's hard to visualize the canvas tents with hand-painted wooden signs that lined this dusty street and served as hotels, saloons, shops and banks in the early 1900's. During the transition from a frontier town to a neon-lined gambling extravaganza, Fremont Street, named after explorer John C. Fremont, has remained at the heart of downtown Las Vegas. For many decades, Fremont Street was where residents shopped, teenagers cruised, and tourist played. \n\nEarly on, canvas tents were replaced with wood, brick, and concrete block buildings in the Romanesque, Victorian and Greek Revival styles. Like a typical western town, wide arcades and broad canopies with carved balustrades extended from high false fronts over the boardwalk. Corner buildings had angled entrances to take advantage of the busy intersection. The most historic survivor of the era is Golden Gate Hotel & Casino (then Hotel Nevada), which open in 1906 at One Fremont Street. The hotel was built using concrete as the primary building material by John F, Miller, who bid successfully on the corner lot at the 1905 land auction that created the new town of Las Vegas.\n\nThe sudden influx of tourism triggered by the construction of Hoover Dam and the legalization of gambling in the early 1930s fit perfectly with a \"Wild West\" theme that Las Vegas promoted, attracting thousands of visitors. Soon \"sawdust joints\" with wooden swinging or sliding glass doors replaced most of the smaller businesses along Fremont Street. Businesses had names like The Frontier Club and Hotel Apache, with signs rising above the rooftops with ornate western lettering and bright contrasting neon colors. \n\n\nSide B:\nDuring the 1940s, Fremont Street exploded with neon as signs became larger and more innovatively arranged, battling to catch the consumer's eye. Modern streamline styles appeared in sign design and many casinos featured lighted overhead canopies and large, rounded, ever-flashing bull nose corners. The height of signs kept increasing, with the famous Las Vegas Club sign rising 120 feet above the sidewalk. Open frame sign appeared on rooftops, and combined with large marquees, they created neon \"wraps\" that covered the entire building façade with dazzling light. The most spectacular \"wrap\" was created at the Golden Nugget in 1956. \n\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s the introduction of high-rise towers forever changed the scale of Fremont Street. Casinos expanded, absorbing neighboring businesses, exemplified by the Horseshoe Club's takeover of Boulder Club and later the Mint. Wild West imagery remained popular, personified by the 1951 \"Vegas Vic\" sign, which waved at visitors with a friendly \"Howdy Podner\" from atop the Pioneer Club. \n\n\nDue to its roots of spectacular lights, the biggest big-screen on the planet, Viva Vision, dazzles over 25,000 visitors nightly with free light and sound shows, and has become the signature attraction of the Fremont Street Experience. This canopy was built in 1995 and contains over 12 million LED lights and has a 550,000-watt sound system. Even with all these profound changes over the last 100 years, much of the history of Las Vegas still exists under the layers of neon on Fremont Street.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 174644, "filename": "174644.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Fremont Street Marker side A", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 562, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.548828125}, {"photo_id": 174645, "filename": "174645.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Fremont Street Marker side B", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 741, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7236328125}, {"photo_id": 174647, "filename": "174647.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Fremont Street Marker side A", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 174649, "filename": "174649.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Fremont Street Marker side B", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 196754, "filename": "196754.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "June 10, 2010", "submitted": "March 17, 2012, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Fremont Street at Night.", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 174651, "filename": "174651.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 760, "aspect": 1.34736842105263}, {"photo_id": 174652, "filename": "174652.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 709, "aspect": 1.44428772919605}, {"photo_id": 174653, "filename": "174653.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 811, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7919921875}, {"photo_id": 174654, "filename": "174654.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 793, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7744140625}, {"photo_id": 174655, "filename": "174655.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 650, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.634765625}, {"photo_id": 174656, "filename": "174656.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "Circa 1970's", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 859, "aspect": 1.19208381839348}, {"photo_id": 228185, "filename": "228185.jpeg", "photographer": "Mike Stroud", "taken": "November 12, 2002", "submitted": "December 10, 2012, by Mike Stroud of Bluffton, South Carolina.", "caption": "at 25 E Fremont Street, \"Vegas Vic,\" as mentioned", "subcaption": "which waved at visitors with a friendly \"Howdy Podner\" from atop the Pioneer Club, can still be found at 25 E Fremont Street", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 683, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6669921875}, {"photo_id": 228186, "filename": "228186.jpeg", "photographer": "Mike Stroud", "taken": "November 12, 2002", "submitted": "December 10, 2012, by Mike Stroud of Bluffton, South Carolina.", "caption": "20 E.

In the United States, neon's popularity soared, used to advertise motels, restaurants, theatres, and it even appeared on the Goodyear Blimp. The spectacular signs of Broadway's \"Great White Way\" became the ultimate neon display. \n\nThen, just as quickly, its popularity faded. After World War II, skilled neon craftsmen retired and were not replaced; less expensive, mass-produced plastic signs became common. As the use of neon declined around the country, it found a new, unexpected life in Las Vegas. The first neon sign in Las Vegas was built in 1929, probably for the Oasis Café at 123 Fremont Street. The 1940s and 1950s saw the birth of the Las Vegas Strip and \"Glitter Gulch\" downtown. The hotels raced each other for the biggest, tallest, and brightest casino sign. \n\n\nLas Vegas wanted to project an image of lights, glamour, and excitement, and neon played a large role in creating that image. The signs dwarf the very buildings they are advertising; at night in Las Vegas, the signs themselves become the architecture. Neon has gaiety, joy, and pageantry. The canvas is the night. \n\nSide B:\nAtomic Testing\nAfter World War II, and during the early stages of the \"Cold War\" with the Soviet Union, the United States began above ground atomic testing in the South Pacific. The decision to move testing to Nevada was made primarily for national security reasons. The area had a small population and was already owned by the federal government. The first test at the Nevada Test Site was conducted on January 27, 1951. The test site was a boon for the Las Vegas economy, providing thousands of jobs and international publicity. \n\n\nMany locals and tourist traveled to Mount Charleston to better view the blasts. The mushroom cloud became a symbol of the times. Atomic hairdos, atomic cocktails, and Miss Atomic Bomb contest became part of Las Vegas culture. Testing moved underground in 1963, after a treaty was signed by the U.S., Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Controversy arose over the issue of the \"Downwinders,\" who were exposed to radiation in the fallout patterns. Health problems for those exposed to the radiation, including soldiers who participated in the tests, are a tragic by-product of the era. The last underground test was September 23, 1993. A portion of the site, Yucca Mountain, is currently being developed for storage of nuclear waste.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 174664, "filename": "174664.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Neon Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 598, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.583984375}, {"photo_id": 174665, "filename": "174665.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 531, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.5185546875}, {"photo_id": 174667, "filename": "174667.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Neon Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 174669, "filename": "174669.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 174670, "filename": "174670.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 827, "aspect": 1.23821039903265}, {"photo_id": 174671, "filename": "174671.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Neon Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 745, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7275390625}, {"photo_id": 174672, "filename": "174672.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Neon Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 549, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.5361328125}, {"photo_id": 174673, "filename": "174673.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "Circa 1940's", "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Neon Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 759, "aspect": 1.34914361001318}, {"photo_id": 174674, "filename": "174674.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 701, "aspect": 1.46077032810271}, {"photo_id": 174675, "filename": "174675.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 838, "aspect": 1.22195704057279}, {"photo_id": 174676, "filename": "174676.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 611, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.5966796875}, {"photo_id": 174677, "filename": "174677.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 933, "aspect": 1.09753483386924}, {"photo_id": 174679, "filename": "174679.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 1, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Atomic Testing Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 756, "aspect": 1.35449735449735}, {"photo_id": 232248, "filename": "232248.jpeg", "photographer": "Courtesy National Nuclear Security Administration", "taken": "April 15, 1955", "submitted": "January 26, 2013.", "caption": "Operation Teapot 1955 Military Effects Test", "subcaption": "Iconic 1955 military photograph taken April 15, 1955, at the Nevada Test Site.

Block 20, between Second and Third and Carson and Bridger, was reserved for public purposes. In 1909 when the state legislature created Clark County, leading citizens contributed $1,800 to build a small one-story concrete-block county courthouse on Carson Street. In 1911 when the City of Las Vegas was incorporated, the city and the county shared the space.\n\nIn 1914 Clark County hired Nevada's most prominent architect, Frederick DeLongchamps, to design a permanent county courthouse. The two-story building cost about $50,000 to construct and furnish, and featured marble and granite interiors. Large columns and Mission-style arches adorned the exterior. The graceful neo-classical structure, set in the middle of the square and surrounded by a park, became a gathering place for county residents. Civic functions were held on the front steps of the courthouse, with the audience seated on the lawn.\n\nAfter 1914 when the county offices moved into the new courthouse, city government offices and later the library shared the old courthouse. The city used that small building as its City Hall until 1942, when it moved into the American Legion War Memorial Building on Fifth and Stewart. The library continued in the 1909 courthouse until 1952, when a library building was constructed.\n\nIn 1959 the county replaced the DeLongchamps building with a seven-story powder blue structure designed by the architectural firm of Zick and Sharp. That building was added to in the 1980's, but in the 21st century, county court functions needed more space.\n\nThe current Regional Justice Center opened at 200 Lewis Avenue in October 2005. County offices are located in the Clark County Government Center at 500 S. Grand Central Pkwy, where a grassy outdoor amphitheater serves as a gathering place for county residents.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 175008, "filename": "175008.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 3, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "County Courthouses Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 647, "aspect": 1.58268933539413}, {"photo_id": 175013, "filename": "175013.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 3, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on County Courthouses Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 673, "aspect": 1.52154531946508}, {"photo_id": 175011, "filename": "175011.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 3, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on County Courthouses Marker", "subcaption": "Photo Captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 804, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.78515625}, {"photo_id": 175016, "filename": "175016.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 3, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on County Courthouses Marker", "subcaption": "Map of", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 175017, "filename": "175017.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 3, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 759, "aspect": 1.34914361001318}, {"photo_id": 175018, "filename": "175018.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 3, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Nearby Historic Preservation Marker", "subcaption": "Photo caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 661, "aspect": 1.54916792738275}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.14414, 36.1686]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 47828, "number": null, "title": "Ralph Louis Engelstad", "subtitle": "January 28, 1930 – November 26, 2002", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": null, "city": "Las Vegas", "subcity": "Downtown Las Vegas", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of South 4th Street and Lewis Avenue, on the right when traveling north on South 4th Street.

The building of Hoover Dam in the 1930s and the rise of the gambling industry in the 1940s and 1950s fueled spectacular growth in the Las Vegas Valley. With the growth came the loss of many of the town's early buildings. Some important buildings that have been lost include the Clark County Courthouse on Second Street (now Casino Center Boulevard), the ice plant on Main Street and the hospital on Eighth and Ogden. Historic preservation efforts have been successful for several properties, including the 5th Street School, the Las Vegas High School, the Old Mormon Fort and the Post Office and Federal Building. The preservation of Las Vegas' early buildings offers us a rare glimpse of our past in this rapidly changing city.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 175205, "filename": "175205.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Historic Preservation Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 656, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.640625}, {"photo_id": 175206, "filename": "175206.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Historic Preservation Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 175207, "filename": "175207.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Rear of", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 175208, "filename": "175208.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 661, "aspect": 1.54916792738275}, {"photo_id": 175209, "filename": "175209.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "Circa 1938", "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "_x000D_\nThe Las Vegas Hospital was open from 1931 to 1988, when it was destroyed by fire.", "subcaption": "Written on photo", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 800, "aspect": 1.28}, {"photo_id": 175210, "filename": "175210.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo Caption", "subcaption": "Photo Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 764, "aspect": 1.34031413612566}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.14417, 36.16845]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 47867, "number": null, "title": "Old Betsy", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2005, "erected_by": "The Commission for the Las Vegas Centennial", "address": null, "city": "Las Vegas", "subcity": "Downtown Las Vegas", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of South Main Street and Garces Avenue, on the right when traveling north on South Main Street.

Principal Maude Frazier overcame public criticism that the location was \"too far out of town.\" Despite opposition, she led a successful bond measure to pay for the school. This noteworthy example of Art Deco architecture was completed in 1930 for $350,000. The new school reflected the growth and maturation of Las Vegas. The Las Vegas Academy now occupies the Las Vegas High School. The building is listed on the local and National Register of Historic Places. \n\nSide B:\nLas Vegas High School Neighborhood\nWith the start of the Hoover Dam project in 1931, Las Vegas began to spread out in all directions. The area around the high school emerged as a significant residential neighborhood. Most of the single-family residences were built between 1928 and the beginning of World War II. The houses featured many different architectural styles, notable Tudor revival, Mission and Ranch. Many of the city's prominent citizens lived in the neighborhood in the 1930s. Starting in the 1980s, many homes were converted to professional offices, while maintaining their architectural and historic charter. Although most of the families are gone, the flavor of the neighborhood is very similar to what it was when it began.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 175329, "filename": "175329.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill

Park Neighborhood Association and Mayor Pro Tem Gary Reese. The plan called for the enhancement of Mary Dutton Park, originally constructed in 1954, through the addition of desert landscaping, public art and a commemorative plaque.\n\nMary Dutton may not be as well known as other Las Vegas pioneers, but you will find her spirit in the streets and backyards of the John S. Park Neighborhood. Mrs. Dutton and her family moved from Lincoln, Nebraska, to southern Nevada in 1919 in search of a warmer climate. They farmed this land before the streets were paved with asphalt, bringing forth an abundance of produce for the community. In the gardens of many residents, you will find the soil still rich, the vegetables still growing and the flowers still blooming – a testament to the time when the Duttons made the desert bountiful.\n\nCity of Las Vegas\n\nLas Vegas City Council: Mayor Oscar B.

Located by the Virginia & Truckee Railroad yard, the mill has 60 stamps, 40 pans, 20 settlers and four agitators; and could process 250 tons of Bonanza ore a day. As ore volume increased in the Con Virginia & California mines, the mill proved inadequate and the Bonanza Firm was compelled to build a second mill called the California Pan Mill at a cost of $500,000.\n\nThe California Pan Mill was the largest mill ever built on the Comstock and consisted of 80 stamps, 46 pans, 20 settlers and 4 agitators with a capacity of processing 380 tons of ore a day. The Con Virginia & California Pan Mills worked the ore by a method known as the Washoe Pan Process. An amalgam of ore, salt, copper sulfate and mercury were used to separate the gold and silver from worthless pulp. Heat was later applied to cook off the mercury. The process did not always collect all the gold and silver, and up to 15 and 20 percent of the values remained in the pans that went into the coffers of the Bonanza Firm.\n\n[Photo captions:]\n[Left] Consolidated Virginia Pan Mill, [Right] Inside the California Pan Mill.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 183149, "filename": "183149.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Consolidated Virginia & California Pan Mill Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 183152, "filename": "183152.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Consolidated Virginia & California Pan Mill Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}, {"photo_id": 183154, "filename": "183154.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Consolidated Virginia & California Pan Mill Marker", "subcaption": "The marker is to the right of the gazebo.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.64738, 39.31217]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 50103, "number": "16", "title": "The Big Bonanza", "subtitle": "Virginia City, Nevada", "subsubtitle": "Comstock Historical Marker No. 16", "erected_year": 2009, "erected_by": "Marshall Earth Resources, Hugh Roy Marshall, Virginia City, Nevada", "address": null, "city": "Virginia City", "subcity": null, "county": "Storey County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on E Street.

In 1872, John Mackay, James Fair, James Flood & William O’Brien formed an alliance and took control of the “Consolidate Virginia” and “California” mines for an investment of about $100,000. The two mining properties were thought by others to be barren ground, but Mackay & Fair who were well seasoned miners thought otherwise. In 1873 an incredibly rich body of ore was struck at the 1,167 foot level that descended down more than 400 feet, it was the “Big Bonanza.” Territorial Enterprise mining editor, Dan DeQuille wrote that it was: “The Heart of the Comstock.” By 1879, the “Consolidated Virginia” had generated $61 million and the “California” $44 million making them the two largest producing mines in the history of the “Comstock Lode.” The quartet, now known as the “Bonanza Kings” were millionaires many times over and proceeded to invest heavily with their winnings. The four organized the “Pacific Pan & Mining Company” to mill ore from their mining operations. The Consolidated Virginia Mill began operations in 1875 and could handle up to 250 tons of ore a day. Later a second and larger mill was built called the “California Pan Mill”, it was the largest mill ever constructed on the “Comstock” and could process up to four hundred tons of ore daily. The four also formed the “Pacific Wood, Lumber and Flume Company” to handle the enormous amount of timber needed for the Comstock mines. A good part of the forest at Lake Tahoe was denuded as lumber was flumed down to the Carson Valley below where teamsters, and later the Virginia and Truckee Railroad would then transport it to Virginia City. In 1875, the “Bonanza Kings” organized the Nevada Bank of San Francisco with offices in San Francisco and Virginia City. By 1875 Virginia City was the most important city between Denver and San Francisco, where 20,000 people resided in Virginia City and Gold Hill. Over 3,000 men were working the Comstock mines and were the highest paid miners in the world at $4.00 per day. Virginia City also played host to some of the greatest engineering feats of the 19th century. Mine superintendent, Philipp Deidesheimer’s invention of square set timbering revolutionized mine timbering and is still used to this day. Water had always been a problem in the mines of the Comstock. Too much in the mines and not enough to drink. Both problems were solved by two Prussian born engineers. In 1869 Adolph Sutro began a nine near [sic] project to drain the mines through a 3.88 mile adit that became known as the Sutro Tunnel. In 1873 Hermann Schussler brought water to the Comstock from Marlette Lake some 30 miles to the west by way of an inverted siphon. Today Virginia City’s water supply still comes from the same source and water from the mines still drains at the mouth of Sutro Tunnel. The Bonanza years ended in 1879 but the mines were still very active and produced another $50 million from 1880 to 1920. By now, the millionaires were long gone from Virginia City, relocating to San Francisco where their Comstock wealth literally built San Francisco. Virginia City’s worst years came during the depression of the 1930’s when only several hundred people lived here. Virginia City today is a lot of the old and some new. It truly was the “Queen of the Comstock” and is a living historical reminder of the greatest mining camp of the American West.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 183160, "filename": "183160.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Big Bonanza Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 183161, "filename": "183161.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Big Bonanza Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.64752, 39.31168]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 50104, "number": "1", "title": "C & C Mining Works", "subtitle": "Consolidated Virginia & California Mine Shaft, L Street, Virginia City, NV", "subsubtitle": "Comstock Historical Marker No. 1", "erected_year": 2009, "erected_by": "Marshall Earth Resources, Hugh Roy Marshall, Virginia City, Nevada", "address": null, "city": "Virginia City", "subcity": null, "county": "Storey County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on E Street, on the right when traveling north.

Prejudice against them was prevalent at the time, due to their strange customs and traditions that was not understood by the rest of society. Consequently, they were denied rights that were taken for granted by the rest of the community. A provision in an early Virginia City mining document of 1859 stated: “No Chinaman shall hold a claim in this district.” When they were found working on the Virginia & Truckee Railroad in 1869, they were run off by local miners who then replaced them. Always industrious, the Chinese found work as gardeners, firewood haulers and household domestics. Several hundred were also employed in numerous laundries during Virginia city’s [sic] “Bonanza’” years. The population of Virginia City reached its zenith in the mid-1870s, when over 20,000 people resided on the Comstock. The census of 1875 recorded 1,331 Chinese living in Storey County at that time, 90% of which were males. By 1900 many Chinese relocated to San Francisco. Today this is all that remains of Virginia City’s Chinatown where its residents lived, prayed in Joss Houses and took recreation in opium dens.\n\n[Photo caption]:\nThe area outlined in white is the general core area that comprised Chinatown. However, it expanded a little more to the North and the South. Chinese artifacts have been located within a four block area indicating there were Chinese residences or business in those areas as well. Chinese artifacts have also been located in several other parts of the community which would indicate that there were some Chinese dispersed throughout Virginia City.

Gass developed a ranch on the site and proveded food for travelers and nearby mining communities. By 1881, the property passed to Archibald and Helen J. Stewart. Although Archibald was killed in a gunfight in 1884, Helen continued to operated the ranch, raising their five children and providing rest and comfort for travelers. In 1902 she sold the ranch, the surrounding land and the water rights to the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. On her former land in 1905, the new town of Las Vegas was born.

The springs allowed the Anasazi Indians and later the Paiute Indians to irrigate small gardens. Between 1829 and 1848, the natural grasslands watered by the creek made this an important stop for New Mexican mule caravans on their way to California. These Spanish-speaking traders named the campsite \"Las Vegas\" (the meadows).\n\n\nAnglos began using the water in 1855, when the Mormons opened a mission about three miles east of the Springs. Later, pioneers John Howell and James B. Wilson developed a ranch at the Springs site. Howell was the first black man to settle in Las Vegas Valley. He arrived in 1870, married a Paiute woman and ran cattle with Wilson from 1872-1874, when Wilson left the valley. In 1876, Howell sold his \"Spring Ranch.\" In 1902, the springs, creek and land were sold to the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, which discontinued ranching at the springs so the water could be used to serve Las Vegas.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 175156, "filename": "175156.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Las Vegas Springs Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 175158, "filename": "175158.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "September 26, 2011", "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Las Vegas Springs Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 175157, "filename": "175157.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "October 4, 2011, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Photo on Las Vegas Springs Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.19241, 36.17032]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 51044, "number": "2", "title": "Lorenzi Park", "subtitle": "1926", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "the City of Las Vegas, Clark County, Preserve America & the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act.", "address": null, "city": "Las Vegas", "subcity": "Twin Lakes", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Twin Lakes Drive, 0.1 miles south of West Washington Avenue, on the left when traveling south.

Lorenzi, opened as a private resort in 1926, became the Twin Lakes Lodge in the 1940s, and a public park in 1966.\n\n\nArriving in southern Nevada in 1911, Lorenzi began building his park on 80 acres of raw land two miles northwest of downtown Las Vegas in the early 1920s. The \"park\" was mostly a grassy area with a swimming hole until the commercial opening in 1926. Lorenzi built two lakes and two islands, one with a band shell and the other a clubhouse. Rowboats, a dance pavilion, swimming pools, horse-back riding and picnic tables were all available for the 10-cent admission fee. Las Vegans flocked to Lorenzi Lake to enjoy music, dancing, spectacular special celebrations and relief from the heat in \"Nevada's largest sanitary swimming pool.\" Celebrities and politicians staged events here, where the powerful rubbed shoulders with ordinary people. \n\n\nCalifornian Thomas Sharp bought the property in 1937 and improved its water supply but let the resort run down. He later leased it to Las Vegan Lloyd St. John who renamed it Twin Lakes Lodge, restored the park, and added a motel. Throughout the 1950s, the motel buildings served as part of a dude ranch, a temporary home for divorce seekers required by state law to live in Nevada for at least six weeks. The city acquired the Twin Lakes Lodge property in 1966, later combined the lakes, filled the swimming pool to create the Sammy Davis, Jr. Festival Plaza and donated the land for the Nevada State Museum and Historical Society.

Boxing champ Joe Louis, part owner of the hotel and official greeter, welcomed crowds of gamblers, performers, visitors and locals to the color – blind entertainment venue. The Moulin Rouge successfully challenged the long – standing segregation practices of the Las Vegas hotel – casino industry.\n\nDespite its popularity, the Moulin Rouge closed in October 1955. Although there are several theories about the reasons for its closure, the truth remains a mystery. In 1960, it again played a major role in the community's slow progress towards integration when civic leaders and NAACP officials met at \"the Rouge\" and informally agreed to desegregate Las Vegas hotels. During the last 50 years, many people have attempted to re – open the fabled resort. Originally built by white investors, the property passed into black ownership in 1989.

Taking a few rock samples, he discovered a mine that led to one of the most important mineral finds of the early twentieth century. As the extent of the bonanza became known, miners and prospectors flocked to the area.\nThe Tonopah boom revitalized the mining West. From 1900 to 1910, newspaper reporters kept busy writing about spectacular new mining camps throughout southern Nevada, including Goldfield, Rhyolite, Kawich, Manhattan, Round Mountain, Wonder, and Fairview. Many proved to be exaggerated but Tonopah continued.\nThe Tonopah mines eventually shipped over 5,000,000 tons of ore. Through a new system called leasing, stock issuing corporations were created, bringing in needed capital to promote the new mines including the Desert Queen, Mizpah, Silver Top, and Tonopah Extension.\nErected this 18th day of July, 2009 by the Transsierra Roisterous Alliance of Senior Humbugs and the Queho Posse.

In the 1940s, United Farmers became California Interstate Telephone Company, which later became Continental Telephone and Telegraph, serving the South Lake Tahoe portion of El Dorado Company, as well as Alpine and and Mono Counties, all in California, and the Stateline, Topaz and Carson Valley portions of Douglas County, Nevada. In certain areas, hand-crank telephones remained in use into the 1960s, and areas such as Fish Springs received their first-ever telephone service in the 1970s.\n\nIn the early 1960s, \"Dial Day\" arrived, allowing telephone customers of the phone company, by using the prefix \"Sunset\", to dial directly anywhere in the Carson Valley without going through a switchboard (attended by as many as eight operators at one time). As recently as the 1980s, many areas in our region, such as Mono and Alpine Counties, could be reached from the Carson Valley only with operator assistance. \nWhen the phone company in the 1970s discontinued the use of prefixes and adopted an all-numbers calling method, the old prefix Sunset became 78, numbers which remain in use today for telephone access in the towns of Minden and Gardnerville. \n\nSunset Park was conceived, designed, engineered, financed, and constructed as a joint effort of Resource Concepts, Inc. (Bruce Scott and Brenda Stein, Project Engineers), Landscape Architect Sandra Wendel, Casinelli Landscaping and Construction, Michael and Angel Gilbert, The Minden Town Board, and the staff of the Town of Minden. Creation of Sunset Park at this location would not have been possible without the assistance and cooperation of Douglas County, the Town of Gardnerville, neighboring landowners, and Verizon (and its predecessors, Contel and GTE).\nMinden Town Board Members - September 3, 2003\nRaymond G.

Constructed of native stone acquired from a nearby quarry, the building served as headquarters for mine operations, living quarters for the Superintendent, and for a brief period a temporary Sheriff's office and courthouse during the early glory days of Belmont. During this time, Belmont grew to a population of several thousand and over a 20 year span yielded 15,000,000 dollars in mineral production.\n\nAfterwards, the building had various residents, one of which was a tall, tough woman with severe blue eyes named Rose Walter. Born in Barley Creek, Nevada, Rose lived in Belmont as a young girl. She later married Jack, a miner, who succumbed to silicosis in the early 1950's. Not wanting to leave Belmont after his death, she remained for another thirty years, eventually becoming the sole permanent resident and self appointed protector of Belmont. Rose carried a .44 caliber pistol which she used to dispatch rattlesnakes (\"I aim for the head and never miss\") and dissuade human scavengers from plundering what was left of Belmont. \"These old houses, such as they are, still belong to someone somewhere\", she is quoted as saying.\n\nKnown as the \"Belmont Guardian\" because of her diligent protection of town property, Ross Walter died in 1987 at the age of 93. Her photo can be found in the June, 1974 issue of National Geographic.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 223072, "filename": "223072.jpeg", "photographer": "Lester J Letson", "taken": "September 21, 2012", "submitted": "October 11, 2012, by Lester J Letson of Fresno, California.", "caption": "Lady Guardian of Old Belmont Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 906, "aspect": 1.13024282560706}, {"photo_id": 223074, "filename": "223074.jpeg", "photographer": "Lester J Letson", "taken": "September 21, 2012", "submitted": "October 11, 2012, by Lester J Letson of Fresno, California.", "caption": "Dedication of Rose Walter marker.", "subcaption": "Members of the Dumbellican Brotherhood of E Clampus Vitus gather around as their first monument is dedicated.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 223075, "filename": "223075.jpeg", "photographer": "Unknown", "taken": "Circa 1900", "submitted": "October 11, 2012, by Lester J Letson of Fresno, California.", "caption": "Belmont, Nevada", "subcaption": "Photo hangs inside Indian Maggie's bar in Belmont.

Later, uplifting and faulting of the terrain caused the waters to drain, leaving behind a thousand feet of sediments and gravel. During the most recent ice age, rivulets of rainwater and snowmelt began to carve gullies out of the softer sediments - siltstone and clay - resulting in the maze of towers, crevices, and canyons at Cathedral Gorge.\n\nMrs. Earl Godbe, an 1890s resident of nearby mining camp called Bullionville, was one of the first visitors to appreciate the drama of this sculpted landscape. Eroded siltstone spires reminded her of European cathedrals, prompting her to suggest the name Cathedral Gulch (later amended to Cathedral Gorge). Over the years, these buff-colored cliffs have also provided residents with a unique backdrop for Biblical pageants and other open-air dramas.\n\nIn 1911, Nephi and Elbert Edwards, two teenage boys from Panaca, began exploring the nooks and crannies of Cathedral Gorge. They and their brothers built a series of ladders through cave-like crevices and crawlways. In the early 1920s, the Edwards families led the movement to preserve and protect the Gorge, which became a state park in 1935.\n\nThe Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the original camping facilities, including the stone water tower near the picnic area and the ramada at Miller's Point, one of the best observation points and trailheads in the park.

At first the crust may just bend. But if the stress is great enough, the rocks will break and \"snap\" to a new position. This usually happens along fractures in the earth known as faults. If the fault lies close to the surface it may become visible following a large earthquake - the area directly in front of you is an example of this.\n\nBetween July and December 1954, six earthquakes and two major aftershocks rocked western Nevada and eastern California. The largest of these, measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale, was centered seven miles west of here and happened on December 16th. These quakes were felt as far away as Elko, NV and Sacramento, CA. More than 50 miles of faulting were exposed on Fairview Peak and in the Stillwater Range to the northwest. In a matter of moments, the mountains lifted up an average of six feet relative to the surrounding valleys. In some places the mountains rose more than 20 feet! Try to imagine what it must have felt like, and how you might have reacted if you had been camping in this area that day.\n\nIf you follow this road south, the exposed fault line is clearly visible in several places. Interpretive signs along the road provide more information. About four miles from here a short side road leads to a parking area next to the fault itself. Four-wheel drive vehicles are not usually required to reach this area, however buses and motor homes should stay on the main road.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 229665, "filename": "229665.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 24, 2009", "submitted": "December 25, 2012, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Fairview Peak Earthquake Faults Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 229666, "filename": "229666.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 24, 2009", "submitted": "December 25, 2012, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "BLM Entry Sign on US 50", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 229667, "filename": "229667.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 24, 2009", "submitted": "December 25, 2012, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Fault Scarp Visible from Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-118.13028, 39.28105]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 62122, "number": null, "title": "Measuring Earthquakes", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Bureau of Land Management", "address": null, "city": "Fallon", "subcity": null, "county": "Churchill County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Unnamed Road, 0.6 miles west of Earthquake Fault Road.

The Richter Scale and the Modified Mercalli Scale are the two methods most often used to gauge an earthquake's strength and magnitude.\n\nThe Richter Scale provides an estimate of an earthquake's magnitude through the use of a very precise instrument called a seismograph. It measures and records the seismic waves, or vibrations, created by the sudden release of energy caused when segments of the Earth's crust move. The scale ranges from 1 to 10, but it is logarithmic. This means for example, that a recording of 7 would show that movement of the earth was 10 times greater than a recording of 6. Earthquakes with a Richter value of 6 or more are considered major in magnitude. The 1954 earthquake that exposed the fault in front of you measured 7.3 on the Richter Scale. By comparison, the famous San Francisco earthquake of 1906 had a value of 8.3 on the scale.\n\nThe Modified Mercalli Scale expresses how intense an earthquake's effects are in a given location. The scale's values range from \"I - Not felt except by a very few, favorably situated\", to \"XII - Damage total, lines of sight and level disturbed, objects thrown into the air\". A value on this scale is assigned only after eyewitness reports and results of field investigations are studied and interpreted. The maximum intensity of the 1954 earthquake was X, the same as the 1964 quake in Alaska. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake measured XI on the scale.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 229668, "filename": "229668.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 24, 2009", "submitted": "December 25, 2012, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Measuring Earthquakes Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "aspect": 1.77469670710572}, {"photo_id": 229669, "filename": "229669.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 24, 2009", "submitted": "December 25, 2012, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "BLM Entry Sign to Earthquake Fault Road on US 50", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 229670, "filename": "229670.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": null, "submitted": "December 25, 2012, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Fault Exposed by 1954 Earthquake", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 734, "height": 979, "aspect": 0.749744637385087}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-118.14673, 39.21168]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 62126, "number": "136", "title": "Toquima Cave", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System and Austin Chamber of Commerce", "address": null, "city": "Austin", "subcity": null, "county": "Lander County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Nevada Route 376, 0.4 miles south of U.S. 50, on the left when traveling south.

In general, the type of horse used for carrying the rider and mail depended greatly on the region. The more fleet-footed thoroughbred horses worked fine on the central prairies, but the strength and endurance of half-broken mustangs were needed to cross the arid deserts and rugged mountain ranges of the West. Alexander Majors, one of the three founders of the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company's Pony Express, chose the California mustang for its strength and endurance, describing it \"as alert and energetic as their riders.\"\n\nAs each of the more than 100 stations spread along the route, relays of horses needed to be kept in sufficient numbers to meet the demands of the relay system. As the C.O.C.&P.P.E.C prepared for the \"start-up\" of the Pony Express, the company estimated that it would take approximately 75 horses to make the nearly 2,000 mile trip from Missouri to California.\n\nA little more than two months before the first riders left from St. Joseph and Sacramento, the firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell began purchasing 500 of the best horses available, paying as much as $200 a head for some stock. One ad, posted in the Kansas Leavenworth Daily Times, asked for \"200 grey mares, from four to seven years old, not to exceed fifteen hands high, well broke to the saddle and warranted sound ...\"\n\nSo, just how far and how long can a horse run? A modern-day horse in good shape can travel at a full gallop on flat terrain for maybe five to eight miles. Over the mountainous terrain in the Sierra Nevada, a horse and rider may be able to cover five miles. Pony Express mustangs could travel at speeds of about 10 miles an hour, but at times could gallop at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. At a full gallop, the distance that the horse could travel before becoming exhausted depended on several variables—if it was a hot or cool day, state of health, and when the horse last had a drink of water.\n\nA good Pony Express rider rode his horse at a steady spring and generally galloped the horse only to get out of harm's way. None were easy to ride, but all agreed that in a race for life and mounted on a half-broken mustang, the express rider could leave danger far behind.\n\n\n\"There were about eighty pony riders in the saddle all the time, night and day, stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to California, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery every single day of the year.\"—Mark Twin, Roughing It, 1872\n\n\n\"The worst imps of Satan in the business. The only way I could master them was to throw them and get a rope around each foot and stake them out, and have a man on the head and another on the body while I trimmed the feet and nailed the shoes on ... It generally took half a day to shoe one of them.\"—Pony Express Farrier and Station Keeper, Levi Hansel, in 1901 describing his experience shoeing half-wild California mustangs at Seneca, Kansas.

News of President Abraham Lincoln's inauguration address was delivered in record-setting time—a mere seven and one-half days.\n\nOn a typical run, Pony Express riders changed horses at \"relay stations\" located every 12-15 miles. At \"home stations,\" spaced about every 75-100 miles, a fresh rider and mount would continue the run to the next relay station.\n\nWith speed however, came limits. Each express rider had a carrying capacity of about 10 pounds. The payload was limited to what could fit into the four pockets of the \"mochila.\"\n\nHigh demand for such limited capacity, combined with the monumental express of funding the system made Pony Express rates extremely high: initially $5.00 per half ounce, or $1,000 per ounce in 2002 dollars. Consequently, other than the military and the U.S. Government, only major newspapers and other well-capitalized businesses and individuals could afford the service.\n\nThe Mochila\nThe mochila, a leather apron that slipped over the rider's saddle, was the most important piece of his gear. It had four small, lockable pouches that securely held the mail as the horse galloped toward the next station.\n\nThe saddles used by Express riders were custom made to be lighter and more streamlined, allowing the mochila to be easily removed from one saddle and tossed over the horn and seat of the saddle on the next horse.\n\nSaddles made by Israel Landis typically were lighter and more comfortable for both horse and rider.\n\nIsrael Landis, saddle maker 1840-1900, St. Joseph, Missouri\n\n(Drawing Caption)\n\"Changing Horses at the Station\" Artist, William Henry Jackson.

By the late 1850s, a half million people had migrated west and were demanding up-to-date news from home. Something had to be done to deliver mail faster and to improve communication in the expanding nation.\n\nThe Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company, a subsidiary of a major freighting company owned by the firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, announced the formation of the Pony Express on January 27, 1860. In hopes of attracting a lucrative contract with the U.S. Postal Service, these entrepreneurs developed a proposal to carry letter mail and telegraphs between Missouri and California in only 10 days.\n\nKnowing that a healthy horse could typically run at a gallop for 8 to 12 miles, the developers needed to place stations at strategic locations for its riders to change mounts. Existing stage stations and road ranches on the eastern end of the route would meet their needs, but new relay stations would have to be built in remote western areas. Alexander Majors purchased up to 500 mustang horses, hired 200 men to manage the stations, and 80 riders signed on to begin the first run of the Pony Express on April 3, 1860.\n\nAlthough the Pony Express captured the admiration and hearts of people around the world, it was a financial disaster for its founders. Eighteen months after starting the Pony Express, it ended with the completion of the Transcontinental Telegraph on October 26, 1861.\n\n\"Every neck is stretched, and every eye strained ...

Many made their way to California. With the surge of settlers, California began to thrive and emerge as a new center of commerce. Businesses and settlers in the West needed a fast way to correspond with their Eastern contemporaries. Recognizing a business opportunity, William Russell, Alexander Majors, and William Waddell established the Pony Express. The Pony Express consisted of relays of men riding horses carrying saddlebags of mail across a 2,000-mile trail between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. The service opened officially on April 3, 1860.\n\nA Dangerous Ride: 120 young riders carried correspondence through dire conditions, bravely speeding across the prairies, mountains, and deserts with only the whip of the wind at their backs. The brave few faced freezing temperatures, limited supply lines, hostile Native Americans, and dangerous raiders. Many riders were killed while making the journey.\n\nExchanging Mail at Schell Creek Station: An individual rider did not typically carry the mail for more than 75 miles (or longer than a 24-hour journey). Swing stations and home stations were established to help the riders make their way across the West. Swing stations were located 10-15 miles apart. At the swing station, a rider dismounted from his tired horse and quickly mounted a fresh horse ready to restart the journey. The exchanges were quick—never lasting more than two minutes—just long enough for the rider to take a quick drink and swing the mochila over the saddle of his new horse. This spot marks the swing station at Schell Creek (Pony Express Station 128).

After amassing a large fortune and building a reputation in the auto-parts industry, Fisher began to dream of building a paved hard-surface, coast-to-coast highway. He envisioned a magnificant roadway that spanned the United States and officially closed the gap between the East and the West forever.\n\nThe Vision: Prior to the Lincoln Highway's completion, the majority of roadways in America were unpaved, dusty trails that aimlessly crooked and kinked from one settlement to the next. The disjointed nature of the roadway did not permit transcontinental travel. Fisher recognized the growing popularity of the automobile and saw the need for a national road which would allow individuals to travel at their own pace, a luxury not afforded by trains.\n\nConstruction began in 1913 with the proposed highway route starting in Times Square in New York City and passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and ending in San Francisco, California's Lincoln Park. As the construction effort moved forward, paving the roadway became an expensive proposition, and much of the route was left unpaved until state and federal funds were invested in the project almost a decade later.\n\nThe Vision Fades: The Lincoln Highway triggered the American people's desire to connect and drive across the nation. Witnessing the economic prosperity that followed the highway route, every state in the Union wanted a named highway built within their borders. Soon, named highways began to pepper the landscape. The new roadways shared routes, intersecting and overlapping in a confusing tangle. The time for a national system of highway was looming.\n\nIn March 1925, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) started plannig a federal highway system. All named roads (including the Lincoln Highway) were ignored in their planning. Eventually, the Lincoln Highway was broken up into U.S. 1, U.S. 30 (including U.S. 30N and U.S. 305), U.S. 530, U.S. 40, and U.S. 50. All road signs featuring the Lincoln Highway name were removed. By the 1940s, the Lincoln Highway had faded away.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 248782, "filename": "248782.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Lincoln Highway Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 248783, "filename": "248783.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Caption", "subcaption": "Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 832, "height": 982, "aspect": 0.84725050916497}, {"photo_id": 248784, "filename": "248784.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Lincoln Highway Route in Nevada", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 748, "height": 901, "aspect": 0.830188679245283}, {"photo_id": 248785, "filename": "248785.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Caption", "subcaption": "Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 453, "aspect": 2.26048565121413}, {"photo_id": 248786, "filename": "248786.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Caption", "subcaption": "Caption", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 832, "height": 729, "aspect": 1.14128943758573}, {"photo_id": 248787, "filename": "248787.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Lincoln Highway Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 248788, "filename": "248788.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 29, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Lincoln Highway Monument", "subcaption": "Located near Marker", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.74104, 39.79731]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 67142, "number": null, "title": "The Pony Express", "subtitle": "April 1860 to October 1861", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Bureau of Land Management", "address": null, "city": "Fallon", "subcity": null, "county": "Churchill County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from U.S. 50, 11 miles north of Nevada Route 722, on the right when traveling north.

It is credited with playing an important part in preserving our nation by keeping California in the Union at the outbreak of the Civil War.\n     Completion of the Transcontinental Telegraph Line in October 1861, put an end to the Pony Express. The \"talking wire\" met the need for urgent communication and the Overland Stage served for general letters.\n     Despite its high prices (up to $5 an ounce at its peak), the Pony Express was a losing enterprise from its beginning. Receipts were often high, but expenses were enormous. In spite of the contributions to the Union and the westward expansion, the Pony never received any financial assistance from the Government.\n     Yet its founders, W.H. Russell, Alexander Majors, and William B. Waddell, felt the need was important, and the Pony Express operated in the red until it went out of business on October 28, 1861, four days after the first coast to coast telegraph message.\n     Pony Express relay stations were from 10 to 35 miles apart along the route and each had two to four men and extra horses. About 500 of the hardiest western horses were bought at prices up to $200 each. There were about 80 riders in all, and they were recruited from the most daring, determined, and toughest \"wiry young fellows\" in the West. Lightly equipped and armed with a Navy Colt revolver, each man rode at least 35 miles in each direction, changing horses at three relay stations along the way.\n     Over his saddle the rider carried the mochila, a leather cover with four mail pouches of letters. He wasted no time at the relay stations, stopping only for water and to transfer the precious mochila onto a waiting horse. Day and night, good weather and bad, winter and summer, the Pony riders covered 10 to 15 miles an hour on their routes. Surprisingly, over the 18 months the Pony operated, only one mail puch was lost and service was held up for only one month during the Indian wars.\n\n     Historic sites like these along the Pony Express Route have been interpreted for your enjoyment as part of the Nation's bicentennial observance of the American Revolution. To aid you in following the Pony Express Route, concrete and wooden posts mark the actual trail.\n\nThe Lonely Vigil ...\n\n     When you think of the Pony Express, the image of the heroic rider, hat blown back by the wind, his horse at full gallop, comes to mind.\n     But have you ever thought much about the men who operated the Pony Express stations? These stationmasters may lack the glamour of the Pony riders, but actually they often endured more hardships and danger than the riders.\n     In Nevada, the basic criteria for selecting a station site was proximity to water, so the stations were not always placed for safety or convenience. The stationmasters were in constant danger of Indian attack, and several were killed by Indians.\n     Except for home stations, where riders exchanged places, the stationmasters had little time to talk to the riders. Their job was only to have a fresh horse ready for the incoming rider. In many stations, it was a lonely life, with the stationmasters far from settlements, fearful of Indian attacks, and always waiting ... waiting for the next rider.\n\nLongest and Fastest ..\n\n     Robert Haslam, known as \"Pony Bob,\" was the best known Pony Express rider in Nevada. Cold Springs Station played a major role in one of the Pony Bob's most exciting adventures—380 mile roundtrip ride in 36 hours—billed as one of the longest and fastest runs in the Pony Express history.\n     It happened in May 1860 when Bob was only 19 years old and western Nevada was in the middle of the Pyramid Lake Indian War.\n     Pony Bob's regular run was from Friday's Station in the Sierras to Buckland's Station near present-day Lahontan Reservoir. He first ran into trouble at Reed's Change Station. The citizens' militia had confiscated all animals for the war and Bob was forced to ride into Buckland's on a nearly-exhausted horse.\n     At Buckland's he was to have been relieved by a rider named Johnson Richardson but, because of the Indian trouble, Richardson refused to ride. The stationmaster W.C. Marley promised Bob a $30 bonus if he'd ride to the next station. So Bob went through three more relief stations to Smith Creek Station, a distance of 190 miles.\n     After a short sleep, Bob turned around and retraced his route. His first stop was Cold Springs.\n     \"When I arrived at Cold Springs, to my horror, I found the station had been attacked by Indians, the keeper killed, and all the horses taken away. I decided in a moment what course to pursue—I would go on.\" At the next station, he told the stationmaster of the danger and advised him to go on to the next station. Bob says, \"He took my advice and so probably saved his life, for the following morning Smith Creek was attacked.\"\n     The rest of the trip was tiring for Pony Bob but reasonably uneventful. He had traveled 380 miles within a few hours of scheduled time, and was surrounded by perils on every hand.\n\nDays versus Seconds ...\n\n     While Pony Express riders like Pony Bob Haslam were setting speed records, another group of hardy westerners was stringing a thin wire that would prove to be fatal to the future of the \"Pony\" and put an end to the West's relative isolation from the rest of the nation.\n     The wire was the Transcontinental Telegraph Line. When completed on October 24, 1861, it met the need for urgent communication between East and West that had created the Pony Express.\n     The Pony and its heroic riders, with skill, luck, and determination, could carry a message 2,000 miles in only 10 days, but it couldn't compete with the \"talking wire\" that could transmit the same message in a mere 10 seconds.\n     The Pony Express, and with it, a colorful era of Western history, was at an end.\n\n     The remains of a Transcontinental Telegraph Station can be seen across the highway to the north. It too has been replaced by yet another innovation—telecommunications.\n\nCold Springs Station Then and Now ...\n\n     Sir Richard Burton, a noted English explorer, came through here on October 15, 1860 and described the station as:\n     \"... a wretched place, half built and wholly unroofed; the four boys, an exceedingly rough set, ate standing, and neither paper nor pencil was known amongst them. Our animals ... found good water in a rivulet from the neighboring hills and the promise of a plentiful fee ... whilst the humans, observing that a beef had been freshly killed, supped upon an excellent steak. We slept ... under the haystack, and heard the loud howling of the wolves, which are said to be larger in these hills than elsewhere.\"\n\n     One of the best preserved Pony Express Stations is Cold Springs, two miles east of here by trail.\n     The 1860 structure is built of large native rocks and mud. It is a large station, measuring 116 feet by 51 feet. The walls are four to six feet high and up to three feet thick. There are four distinct rooms--storage area, barn, corral, and living quarters. It is interesting to note the horse corral is located next to the living quarters. This was done primarily as a safety measure to guard the valuable animals, but also to take full advantage of their body heat during cold Nevada winters. The only other source of heat was from one small fireplace. Gun ports along the walls can still be seen.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 248811, "filename": "248811.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": "(Panel 1)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 697, "aspect": 1.46915351506456}, {"photo_id": 248812, "filename": "248812.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": "(Panels 2 and 3)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 706, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.689453125}, {"photo_id": 248813, "filename": "248813.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": "(Panels 4 and 5)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 683, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6669921875}, {"photo_id": 248814, "filename": "248814.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": "(Panel 6)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 248815, "filename": "248815.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": "(Panels 7 and 8)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 683, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6669921875}, {"photo_id": 248816, "filename": "248816.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": "(Panels 9 and 10)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 733, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7158203125}, {"photo_id": 248818, "filename": "248818.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The Pony Express Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 590, "aspect": 1.73559322033898}, {"photo_id": 248819, "filename": "248819.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "View to East towards Marker and Cold Springs Station Location", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.85139, 39.39175]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 67144, "number": "83", "title": "Rock Creek", "subtitle": "(Cold Springs Station)", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology and Austin Chamber of Commerce", "address": null, "city": "Fallon", "subcity": null, "county": "Churchill County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 50, 11 miles north of Nevada Route 722, on the left when traveling north.

However, Division Superintendent Thomas Plain's support ranch, one mile to the west, kept this important team-watering and stock replacement stop operating.\n\nCompletion of the first transcontinental railroad meant the eventual demise of the Overland Stage line. In 1866, Butterfield sold out to Wells Fargo and Company. By February 1869 Wells Fargo suspended all operations on the Central route and the New Pass station faded into history.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 248826, "filename": "248826.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "New Pass Station Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 777, "aspect": 1.31788931788932}, {"photo_id": 248827, "filename": "248827.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "New Pass Station Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 248828, "filename": "248828.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "May 30, 2013", "submitted": "July 30, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Remains of New Pass Station", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258518, "filename": "258518.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 6, 2013", "submitted": "October 23, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "New Pass Station & Back of Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.51012, 39.56734]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 67146, "number": "111", "title": "Edwards Creek Valley", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "State Historic Preservation Office, Department of Cultural Affairs, and Austin Chamber of Commerce", "address": null, "city": "Austin", "subcity": null, "county": "Churchill County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 50, 23 miles north of Nevada Route 722, on the right when traveling north.

After the Southern Pacific took over the railway in 1899 and relocated much of its Nevada alignment, the old Central Pacific roadbed between Sparks and Wadsworth was deeded to Washoe County in 1904 for road purposes. In 1917, this road became a portion of State Road 1, which in 1920 became the Nevada section of the Victory Highway. In 1925, when Federal highway names were replaced by a numerical system, the Victory Highway became U.S. Highway 40.

The large, strange beasts were a huge hit, and people who saw one could not find words to describe the animal.\n\nOn the trail, the term came to be associated with the difficulties of the journey. It was almost a badge of honor to say that you had \"seen the elephant,\" had experienced difficulties that others would not understand or believe, and had made it through. This part of the California Trail was one of the places where the elephant was often \"seen.\"\n\n(Drawing Captions)\n\"Here, indeed, was a picture of misery, which, if I had witnessed before being hardened to scenes of the like character, would have made my heart's blood run cold, and even now the chill of horror ran over me like electricity. Dead horses and oxen, in great numbers, with steaks cut out of their flesh, lay scattered over the land, and men, without a morsel to eat, were begging from wagon to wagon, offering all they had for a little dry bread. The more dishonest, however, were practicing the crafty scheme of theft.\"\nJohn T. Clapp; July 15, 1850\n\n(illegible) glimpse of the posterior parts of the elephant.

Later, after the death of his trapper Joseph Paul, Ogden renamed the stream Paul's River, then Swampy River, finally Mary's River, from the legendary Indian wife of one of his trappers. In 1833 the Bonneville - Walker fur party named it Barren River.\n\nOgden's or Mary's River were commonly used names for the Humboldt prior to the publication of John C. Fremont's map in 1848.\n\nThe Humboldt was the only natural arterial across the Great Basin. It funneled thousands of emigrants along its valley enroute to the Pacific Coast during the period 1841-1870.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 249841, "filename": "249841.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 8, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Humboldt River Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 249842, "filename": "249842.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 8, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Humboldt River Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 249843, "filename": "249843.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 8, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Markers at Button Point Rest Area", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.57354, 41.01664]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 67429, "number": null, "title": "International Intrigue and the Humboldt River", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Bureau of Land Management", "address": null, "city": "Winnemucca", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Interstate 80 at milepost 187, on the right when traveling west.

That someone was Peter Skene Ogden, who traveled south from Oregon and first arrived on the Humboldt near here in late 1828.\n\nOgden worked for the Hudson's Bay Company, an early 19th century fur-trade enterprise that also furthered the interests of its home country—Great Britain. Having fur traders active in the West was a way to \"check\" or \"counter\" American expansionism. Ogden and his men tried to trap all the beaver out of this valley twice so that Great Britain could claim the land, but it didn't work. Under the pretense of \"exploring new country\" they were actually violating the sovereign territory of another nation—Mexico.\n\nWith the treaty that ended the Mexican-American War in 1848, the Great Basin became part of the United States. In 1850 this area became part of Utah Territory, established after the State of Deseret that was proposed by the Mormons in Salt Lake City in 1849 was rejected by Congress. In 1864, the Humboldt River Valley then became part of the new State of Nevada.\n\n(Drawing Caption)\n\"...The water in this river is very muddy, warm and in my opinion very unwholesome, for in all my travels in the Snake Country the camp have never been so sickly as in this stream.\"\nPeter Skene Ogden; 1829", "photos": [{"photo_id": 249844, "filename": "249844.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 8, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "International Intrigue and the Humboldt River Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 679, "aspect": 1.50810014727541}, {"photo_id": 249845, "filename": "249845.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 8, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Markers at Button Point Rest Area", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.57349, 41.01663]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 67431, "number": null, "title": "About Your Journey ...", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Bureau of Land Management", "address": null, "city": "Winnemucca", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Interstate 80 at milepost 187, on the right when traveling west.

Did you know that since entering Nevada you have been traveling along the route of the historic California Trail? From 1843 to 1869, an estimated 250,000 people made the trek from the Missouri River to California on a rutted dusty road that was a dramatic contrast to today's high-speed freeway.\n\nThe California Trail began at the Missouri River and crossed the future states of Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Nevada before reaching California. The distance was approximately 2,000 miles. The California Trail was the major travel route to the West until the Pacific Railroad was completed in 1869.\n\nOnly a few hours of driving time has brought you from Reno or Carson City in western Nevada to this point. For a California emigrant, the same distance took over two weeks of walking in the heat and dust of August and September, and upon reaching the Sierra Nevada mountains, they still had 150 miles of walking and climbing before they would reach their destination, central and northern California.\n\nAs you travel east, you will parallel the California Trail from here to Wells, Nevada - about 90 miles, or six days of emigrant travel. From Wells, the trail turns northeast into Idaho and does not rejoin Interstate 80 until Fort Bridger, Wyoming.

Hastings was an early entrepreneur who thought he had found a shorter route to California, claiming that his \"cutoff\" would save emigrants 400 miles and several days of travel. He promoted this route with an Emigrant Guide. Although he had not actually traveled the route, he persuaded a number of 1846 emigrants to travel with him, leaving the established California Trail at Fort Bridger, Wyoming.\n\nHastings and his initial group ran into difficulties almost from the start. First, they had to find their way west through the punishing geographical maze of the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, and then endure 80 miles without water across the desert and salt flats west of the Great Salt Lake. This was followed by the high desert of eastern Nevada and a long detour around the Ruby Mountains. After these hardships, they had to travel through South Fork Canyon, making 14 crossings of the river before they could rejoin the California Trail.\n\nThe Donner-Reed party of 1846 had also been persuaded to follow Hastings. After much travel and loss of livestock, furniture, and wagons on the Salt Flats, they found upon rejoining the California Trail that they had actually added 125 miles to their journey. They also spent three additional weeks of travel time. Just a few days short of reaching the Sierra Nevada pass that would eventually be named for their group, the Donner-Reed party was trapped by an early snowstorm and suffered tragic consequences through the winter of 1846-47. Their tragedy put an end to travel on the Hastings Cutoff.\n\n(Drawing Caption)\n\"Never take no cutoffs and hury along as fast you can.\"\nVirginia Reed, in a letter to her cousin, May 16, 1847", "photos": [{"photo_id": 250135, "filename": "250135.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 10, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "The End of the Hastings Cutoff Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 641, "aspect": 1.59750390015601}, {"photo_id": 250136, "filename": "250136.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 10, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "California Trail Markers", "subcaption": "At entrance to the California Emigrant Trail Interpretive Center", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 250137, "filename": "250137.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 9, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Canyon of the South Fork of the Humboldt River", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 522079, "filename": "522079.jpeg", "photographer": "By John J.

Crossing the salt flats just east of here was extremely difficult. Stock animals perished, wagons broke down, and the emigrants barely reached the life-saving springs at the base of Pilot Peak.

Living in the basin was extremely challenging for the Goshute people as they faced dramatic changes in temperature and unforgiving terrain. However, the people connected with the land and prospered in the area. They hunted deer, elk, and antelope, and gathered berries, roots pine nuts, and grasses to sustain themselves.\n\nA Life Changed: Though the desolation of the area served to protect the Goshutes in 1827 outsiders arrived and began to influence the people. By the mid-1800s, essential lands were overtaken by the settlers to make way for stage stations and Pony Express routes. The placement of the stations and routes prevented the Goshute people from accessing water and their traditional hunting and gathering sites. With access to their lands restricted, hostilities grew between the settlers and the Goshutes. The tensions burned for several years until a treaty was signed on October 12, 1863. The treaty ultimately resulted in the creation of two reservations: 17248 acres for the Skull Valley Goshute band and 108,000 for the Deep Creek Goshute band, through the reservations were not formally established until 1912.\n\nA Life to Live: The Goshute people have faced many hardships since the first group of trappers and explorers entered their lives in 1827, forever changing the Goshute story. In the midst of the chaos and upheaval, the people have maintained their cultural values and have continued to foster their connection to the arid desert landscape. It is this connection that keeps them bound to their birthplace, connected to their ancestry, and looking forward to a lasting future.\n\n(Upper Right Image Caption)\nThe pinyon pine nut was an essential food source for the Goshute people.

The jackrabbit and pronghorn antelope are just two of the many animals that have adapted to living in this harsh environment.\n\nThis area wasn't always a desert. Limber pine trees covered the Leppy Hills to the east from 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. As the climate became drier, pinyon pine and juniper trees replaced the limber pines at the lower elevations. Pinyon pines are relative newcomers to the surrounding mountains. They didn't arrive until about 7,000 years ago. Today, limber pine and subalpine fir grow only at the higher, cooler and wetter elevations on Pilot Peak and nearby mountain ranges. Animals you might encounter in these forested areas include bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk and mountain lion.\n\nIn the fall thousands of raptors (birds of prey) migrate south along this valley. The Great Salt Lake Desert's lack of food, water and lifting air currents form a migration barrier for these birds. Food, water and roosting sites are easy to find in the Toano and Goshute Ranges. Air rising over these mountains to the west provides the lift these birds need to soar. Conserving energy by soaring as much as possible during their long journeys is a key to their survival.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 251738, "filename": "251738.jpeg", "photographer": "Duane Hall", "taken": "July 5, 2013", "submitted": "August 21, 2013, by Duane Hall of Abilene, Texas.", "caption": "Can Anything Survive Here?

During that time the water level of Lake Bonneville rose because of colder temperatures and a wetter climate.

If you were standing in this spot 15,000 years ago, you would be more than 500 feet underwater!

These raging floodwaters deepened the Snake River Canyon in Idaho. A warmer and drier climate over the next 5,000 years slowly caused the lake to shrink even further. Look carefully at the surrounding hills, especially east toward Wendover. You can still see the beach terraces left at the different high water marks as the lake receded.

They were the last owners to operate the Clover Valley Mountains steam engine.\n\nLocal lumbering ventures were generally small-scale, employing a dozen men to cut pinyon and ponderosa pine and to guide the teams of horses, mules or oxen which dragged the felled logs to the mill. Workers at the sawmill fed firewood and water to the engine boiler, generating steam pressure to drive the pistons of the engine. Belts attached to the flywheels propelled a carriage track and the saw blade, mounted on a separate unit behind the steam engine. Logs were passed through the saw blade to remove bark and square them for finishing. Successive passes through the saw blade planed the rough-cut logs into mining timbers, railroad ties, and building materials. Loads of finished lumber were then freighted by wagon many miles over rugged terrain to local mining camps and settlements. The six ton steam engine and other sawmill equipment were moved to a new location whenever the nearby timber stands were cut.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 257893, "filename": "257893.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 4, 2013", "submitted": "October 18, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Clover Valley Mountains Steam Engine/Sawmill Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 257894, "filename": "257894.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 4, 2013", "submitted": "October 18, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Clover Valley Mountains Steam Engine/Sawmill Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.38508, 37.79571]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 69474, "number": "203", "title": "Bullionville", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System, Nevada Historical Society", "address": null, "city": "Panaca", "subcity": null, "county": "Lincoln County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 93 at milepost 109, on the left when traveling north.

For example, Martin Gleeson, was murdered by his partner John Roach over a mining claim dispute. Gleeson's obelisk-style headstone can be seen in the cemetery.\n\nBoomtown wives and children faced difficult adjustments to frequent moves and few conveniences. Joseph Liddle's wife Margaret bore five children in White Pine County. The records of their births provide a glimpse of the mobile life-style involved with mining. Mable was born in Hamilton in 1872, Arthur in Aurum in 1875, Josephine in Hamilton in 1880, Ruth in Hamilton in 1882 and Laura in Ward in 1887.\n\nThe graves inside the Ward cemetery are marked by headstones, large stones and many appear today as simple mounds earth or piles of wood.

In the 1860's, silver and gold deposits were discovered nearby in what became the Robinson Mining District. Ely developed as a regional center, becoming the White Pine County seat in 1887. The area grew dramatically in the early 1900s with major copper discoveries. The Nevada Northern Railway, headquartered in East Ely, carried ore from the mines at Ruth to the McGill smelter, as well as connecting Ely to the world on its 150 mile route north to the transcontinental railroad. \nThe towns of eastern Nevada were joined during the late nineteenth century by a network of wagon roads. In 1913, the road through Ely was incorporated into the transcontinental Lincoln Highway, though it was not paved until 1922. Ely had over 2,000 residents and offered many services, making it an excellent stopping place on the long road across the Great Basin. When the copper industry declined during World War I, the struggling town turned to travelers for income. \nThe Lincoln Highway was designated US 50 in 1926. By mid-century the popularity of the Victory Highway, now Interstate 80, reduced US 50 to the status of \"The Loneliest Road in America.\" \nIn addition to the Lincoln Highway, two other major national roadways converge at Ely. The Midland Trail, designated Route 6 in 1937, was an early coast to coast automobile road that also connected Ely to Tonopah and Southern California. US 93, which passes north-south through Ely, takes travelers from Canada almost to the Mexican border.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 257972, "filename": "257972.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 4, 2013", "submitted": "October 19, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Ely - Forging the Link Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 257973, "filename": "257973.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 4, 2013", "submitted": "October 19, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Ely - Forging the Link Marker", "subcaption": "View west on Aultman Street.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 257974, "filename": "257974.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "Circa  October 4, 2013", "submitted": "October 19, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "photo on Ely - Forging the Link Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 257975, "filename": "257975.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 4, 2013", "submitted": "October 19, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "photo on Ely - Forging the Link Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 640, "aspect": 1.6}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.89122, 39.2482]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 69492, "number": "98", "title": "Osceola", "subtitle": "1872-1940", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System, White Pine Museum, Inc.", "address": null, "city": "Ely", "subcity": null, "county": "White Pine County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 6 at milepost 72.7, on the right when traveling east.

Since then, miners have struggled to reach minerals deep within these hillsides of the Eureka Mining District - a vital part of Nevada's mining heritage and future. \nBy 1878, the population of Eureka and nearby Ruby Hill was over 9,000. The Eureka Mining District ranked as Nevada's second richest mineral producer (the Comstock ranked first). Ore veins of silver, lead, and other base materials were rich enough to justify enormous underground mine development and financial risk. \nEureka's greatest production was from 1870 to 1890. By 1900, changing market conditions reduced demand for the District's materials. Many of the mines closed. A few smaller mines remained in operation until the 1920s, but it was nothing like the early days. \nRevival of the Eureka Mining District has recently occurred with the introduction of a mining technology called heap leaching. This method allows for profitable and more efficient processing of rock containing trace amounts of gold.\nExamples of old and new mining operations can be seen from here. At the base of the hill is the heap-leach pad and rock piles of a modern mining operation. Near the top of the hill is the Fad Shaft (illustration right), a remnant of earlier mining days. \n\nThe Fad Shaft - This Area's Last Underground Mining Operation\nProspectors discovered the Fad claim in 1906 but did not start mining until the 1940s. Geological theory suggested that ore existed 2,500 feet below the surface. From the 1940s to the 1960s, sporadic mining occurred at the shaft. Then at 2,465 feet, only 35 feet from their target, they encountered water. Flooding was so great that mining halted. The Fad closed a short time later. Ironically, the Fad Shaft, the last attempt at underground mining in the Eureka District, never produced any ore. \nMany hills around Eureka still contain rock piles, open shafts, and abandoned mining equipment. During Eureka's heyday, many headframes similar to the Fad dotted these hillsides. Most have since disappeared, leaving only a handful as reminders of the past.\n\nModern Gold Mining\nHeap leaching removes trace amounts of gold from rock that would have been considered worthless in mining days of old. The gold is so small that it can only be seen with a microscope. Gold bearing rock is crushed into pebbles and pled (heaped) onto a thick plastic liner. A weak cyanide mixture dissolves the gold while gravity slowly draws (leaches) the gold-laden solution into collection tanks. \nThroughout history mining has changed the landscape. Mining's effects have changed as technology has advanced. Reclamation is now standard practice upon mine closure. Whether underground or surface, mining remains an important symbol of Nevada's heritage.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 258372, "filename": "258372.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 6, 2013", "submitted": "October 22, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "The Eureka Mining District Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258370, "filename": "258370.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 6, 2013", "submitted": "October 22, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "The Eureka Mining District Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258371, "filename": "258371.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 6, 2013", "submitted": "October 22, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "The Eureka Mining District Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258373, "filename": "258373.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 6, 2013", "submitted": "October 22, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "The Eureka Mining District Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.99577, 39.55529]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 69609, "number": "176", "title": "The Surveyors", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System and Nevada Highway Department", "address": null, "city": "Austin", "subcity": null, "county": "Lander County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Highway 50, on the right when traveling east.

Mr. Russell's partners hesitated due to the projected high costs; he persevered and the first ride began on April 3, 1860. \nOverland stagecoach stations were located every 10-12 miles as far as Salt Lake City. Eighty skilled and experienced riders, 400 horses and approximately one hundred-eighty-four stations were built in two months. There were thirty stations across Nevada from Utah to Genoa at the eastern base of the Sierra. The swift riders carried the mail 2,000 miles in 10 days from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California. The \"Pony\" improved nationwide communication, western expansion and was credited with California's continued participation in the Union at the beginning of the Civil War. \nA high price was paid for the improved communication, including the cost to post a letter and the trials of the employees during the ride. The cost of mailing a letter as advertised was not economical, \"letters less than 1/4 oz cost $5.00 and so on.\" The riders, station masters and division agents faced hostile environments including poor housing, extreme heat and cold, poor access to potable water, food and dangers due to the conflicts between Native Americans and the newcomers to the west. \nOn October 24, 1861, the telegraph was born and the last ride was completed. What had taken ten days could be achieved in ten seconds thus ending the Pony Express.

With discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859, Spooner Summit became a focal point on the most heavily traveled branch of the bonanza road system linking Placerville, California, and the new towns east of the Sierra Nevada. Territorial governments granted franchises to private individuals or companies, allowing them to build and maintain toll roads. The Rufus Walton (Clear Creek) Toll Road replaced Johnson's Cutoff in 1860, providing a better route around the southeast shore of Lake Tahoe via Glenbrook. \nThis route was improved in 1863 with completion of the Lake Tahoe (Bigler) Wagon Road, also called the Kings Canyon Road. About 5,000 teamsters were moving goods along roads leading to the Comstock in 1863, but traffic began to decline in 1875. \nStations were built at convenient intervals along the roads. Swift's Station was about two miles east of Spooner Summit on the Kings Canyon road. In 1863, Spooner's Station, located near the current junction of US 50 and SR 28 (a mile west of here), had a hotel, saloon, houses, blacksmith shop, and two barns. \nLumber for the Comstock\nMassive amounts of wood were sent to the Comstock Lode from the Carson Range and the Tahoe Basin. Initially wood was hauled by wagon, but soon the transport system included trains, steamboats, and water flumes. \nSpooner Summit is in the midst of a former logging landscape. In 1873, logging in the area was consolidated by formation of the Carson and Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company. Workers were housed at a small settlement called Summit Camp, built along one side of the toll road. From 1875 to 1898 the company operated the Lake Tahoe railroad along 8.75 miles of line from Glenbrook to this spot. The difficult route included switchbacks and a 487-foot tunnel just west of the summit. The narrow-gauge railroad's sole purpose was to haul timber and lumber for building purposes and cordwood for fuel. This wood was transferred to an 11-mile long V-flume that extended from Spooner Summit down Clear Creek to Carson Valley. There the wood was loaded on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad for the rest of its trip to the Comstock. At its peak the Comstock consumed about 80 million board feet of lumber and 2 million cords of firewood each year. About 300,000 board feet of wood passed over Spooner Summit each day. \nEarly Motoring\nIntroduction of automobiles into the Tahoe Basin rapidly changed the character of the place, making it accessible for far more people as a growing tourist destination. Early in the twentieth century, the decaying bonanza system of wagon roads had to serve the needs of automobile travelers. \nIn 1913, the Lincoln Highway Association designated the road up Kings Canyon, over Spooner Summit, and through Glenbrook as part of the Lincoln Highway. The highway was a private concept intended to enhance long-distance automobile travel by establishing the first transcontinental route. Actual work on this section began in 1914 when the Carson Good Roads Association placed redwood markers every mile. Each marker displayed the highway symbol and distances to Carson City, Glenbrook, and San Francisco. During this period one motorist described part of the road as \"a narrow shelf along a barren, rocky mountain side.\" \nLittle more than light maintenance was done on the road even after it was included in the Nevada State Highway System as part of Route 3. In 1923, the portion of Route 3 between Spooner's Station and the state line was incorporated into the Forest highway System, making funding available for major improvements. In 1927 and 1928, a graded two-lane automobile road was built along Clear Creek, over Spooner Summit, and on to Glenbrook. A combination of state and Forest Highway funds paid for the work. The new road became part of US 50. In the 1930s, the road was oiled and surfaced with asphalt. Snow removal allowed year-round access to the lake. Finally, in the late 1950s, this portion of US 50 was upgraded to the present four lanes.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 258751, "filename": "258751.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 7, 2013", "submitted": "October 25, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Spooner Summit Marker", "subcaption": "Click on photo to view historical photos displayed on marker.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258752, "filename": "258752.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 7, 2013", "submitted": "October 25, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Spooner Summit Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258753, "filename": "258753.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 7, 2013", "submitted": "October 25, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Spooner Summit", "subcaption": "Spooner Summit Marker is on rock at left and green highway summit sign is in center of photo.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 258754, "filename": "258754.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "October 7, 2013", "submitted": "October 25, 2013, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Spooner Summit", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.89563, 39.10424]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 69715, "number": "225", "title": "Spooner Area", "subtitle": "Logging and Lumbering Period 1868 – 1895", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Division of Historic Preservation and Archeology, Division of State Parks", "address": null, "city": "Incline Village", "subcity": null, "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Nevada Route 28, 0.7 miles west of U.S. 50.

The Neon Boneyard Park sign includes hidden reference to this aspect of the grand history of Las Vegas signage. Each letter in the word \"Neon\" is taken from the typography of a famous sign. The first \"N\" is classic Golden Nugget. The \"e\", from Caesars Palance, is perhaps most recognizable. The \"o\" is from Binion's Horseshoe, and the final \"n\" celebrates the Desert Inn. Each of these historic signs can be found in the Neon Museum Boneyard. \n\nPanel two: Neon Signs Project\nThe Neon Signs Project partners the Neon Museum with the City of Las Vegas to install restored signs from the Museum collecting along Las Vegas Blvd, illuminating downtown Las Vegas. In 2009, the stretch of Las Vegas Blvd. between Sahara Ave. and Washington Ave. was designated a National Scenic Byway, one of only three urban Byways in the country. The National Scenic Byways Program is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. The first sign was the Hacienda Horse and Rider, installed in 1997 at Fremont Street. Binion's Horseshoe, the Bow & Arrow Motel, and the Silver Slipper were erected in 2009.\n\nPanel three: The Neon Museum\nThe Neon Museum was established as a non-profit organization in 1996 to collect; preserve, and exhibit neon signs, the classic Las Vegas art form. The collection is housed in the famous Boneyard, with additional restored signs located at the Fremont Street outdoor gallery and along Las Vegas Blvd. as part of the National Scenic Byways \"Neon Signs\" project. The Museum celebrates the distict architectural and design innovation of the Las Vegas neon sign. \n\nPanel four: The La Concha Motel Lobby\nOriginally located at 2955 Las Vegas Blvd. South, the sweeping Googie arches of the La Concha Motel lobby defined on era. Built in 1961 by the Doumani Family, architect Paul R. Williams was the first African-American member of the American Institude of Architects. Planned for demolition, the Doumani family instead promised the building to the Neon Museum in 2005. In 2006 the shell was relocated, and in 2007 the building was reassembled at its new home.

Designed by Saco Rienk DeBoer, it was a federal reservation. Only workers associated with the building or operations of the dam could live in the new community. Gaming and alcohol were both banned initially, and today Boulder City is the only incorporated city in Nevada where gaming is not allowed.\n\nThe community grew quickly. The post office opened and the rail line was completed to the dam site in 1931. The first airport opened in 1933. With the completion of the Boulder Canyon Project, the town became the home of dam workers and their families. \n\nIn 1959, the community was incorporated, with a celebration held on January 4, 1960. The land and buildings owned by the federal government were turned over to the new city. Since then, the community has grown, becoming the gateway to Hoover Dam.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 266869, "filename": "266869.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "February 18, 2014", "submitted": "February 21, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Boulder City, Nevada Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 575, "aspect": 1.78086956521739}, {"photo_id": 266870, "filename": "266870.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "February 18, 2014", "submitted": "February 21, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Boulder City, Nevada Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 575, "aspect": 1.78086956521739}, {"photo_id": 266871, "filename": "266871.jpeg", "photographer": "Bill Kirchner", "taken": "February 18, 2014", "submitted": "February 21, 2014, by Bill Kirchner of Tucson, Arizona.", "caption": "Boulder City, Nevada Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 575, "aspect": 1.78086956521739}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.83462, 35.98011]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 72354, "number": null, "title": "Atlatl Rock", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Valley of Fire State Park", "address": null, "city": "Overton", "subcity": "Overton", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Atlatl Rock south of Campground Road.

His name comes from the founder of the State Line Hotel & Casino, Mr. William “Bill” Smith, who started the State Line Service, a cobble stone service station, on the Utah/Nevada border in 1926. Prior to Wendover Will arriving, visitors were greeted by a shimmering light atop a tall pole that provided a signal of sorts to weary travelers crossing the Great Basin Desert, that they were within reach of this small but important oasis on Highway 40 called Wendover. With gaming legalized in the state of Nevada in 1931, State Line Service grew into the State Line Hotel & Casino, a company which until its sale in 2002 to the Wendover Nugget Hotel & Casino, was on record as the single longest held gaming license in Nevada. As this growth took place, in 1952 after 26 years that light stop the pole was retired making way for what has become a community and State icon, Wendover Will.\n\nWendover Will was constructed and erected by Young Electric Sign Company out of Salt Lake City, Utah, who has been providing electric and other sign services since 1920. At the time Wendover Will was created, his small twin “Vegas Vic” was also completed, who today stands adjacent to Las Vegas’ famed Freemon Street. Wendover Will made the Guiness Book of World Records as the “world’s largest mechanical cowboy”. At the time he stood 63 feet tall, had 1,184 lineal feet of neon tubing with his two large waving arms powered by a single ¾ horsepower motor, his eye winking and cigarette flicking. The original pedestal of Wendover Will proclaimed proudly “This is the Place” “Where the West Begins”.\n\nWendover Will through time proved to become not only an icon of the State Line Hotel & Casino, but as well became an icon of the community itself. When West Wendover, Nevada, was incorporated in 1991, Wendover Will took a prominent position in the creation of the City Seal which proclaims proudly “Come Grow With Us,” a true reflection of the original light atop a pole and later the waving arms of a towering mechanical cowboy, welcoming all to this desert oasis.\n\nWendover Will was given to the City of West Wendover by Wendover Nugget Hotel & Casino in 2004 and now he once again stands tall representing to all, the heritage of our community as “this is the place” “where the west begins”.\n\nThis monument is hereby dedicated in loving memory to two important and founding members of our community, William “Bill” and Anna Smith.\n\nWe thank the many involved from the City of West Wendover, the State of Nevada, Young Electric Sign Company and other businesses and individuals; all who have given their time, efforts and support to help bring this monument to fruition.\n\nCity of West Wendover, Nevada 2005.\n\nMayor,\nJosephine E.

His trek home, around 1859 or 1860, included a stop in the marshy valley known as the Truckee Meadows, located north of the Comstock Mining District, it was obvious that the pioneer trail to the Sierra Nevada was going to get busy.\n\nFuller found the highest piece of ground along the Truckee and built a log bridge near this site. He charged a small toil for crossing. He also built a log shelter that was popular among the tired and dusty prospectors. A spring flood washed away the bridge in 1861. He rebuilt the bridge, but Fuller was looking for a way out of the toll business.\n\nMyron C. Lake, was another disillusioned miner who decided ranching might be the real Mother Lode of the West. He settled on a ranch near Honey Lake north of the Truckee Meadows, but barely made a living. Lake saw much more than just a way to cross the river on Fuller’s rickety bridge and traded his land to Fuller for the franchise.\n\nLake built a stronger bridge and moved it upstream to a better footing. He added an inn for weary travelers and even offered hot meals and libations at his tavern. The profits grew and so did “Lake Crossing.” By 1862 there was a grist mill, a livery stable and a kiln. Lake’s vision did not stop there. He lobbied hard for a transcontinental railroad to pass through his town before climbing the Sierra Nevada.\n\nIn 1888 the building was renamed the Riverside Hotel with a new owner and manager Harry Gosse. Gosse replaced the old wooden structure with brick. In 1922 the structure burned down and soon after George Wingfield purchased the property. Wingfield hired notable Nevada architect Frederic J.

In 1875 the company added a second story to the new fire hall that housed the steamer, a two-wheel hose cart, and a four-wheel hose carriage now displayed in the Comstock Fireman’s Museum in Virginia City. Rent from the previous fire hall helped pay for the new structure.

The Silver Terrace was not the only Comstock complex, both Gold Hill and Silver City had their own cemeteries. The earliest cemeteries were established far away from the ore veins. As it turned out, they were too well removed and were abandoned due to the lengthy commute from town.\n\nTypically the first cemeteries in Western American mining towns were haphazard, unplanned affairs. At the beginning of the Comstock in 1859, the dead were often buried in a convenient hole, sometimes created by exploratory mining. As more people came, there was a need for designated and plotted lands for burials. By 1867, the Silver Terrace collection of eleven cemeteries was established by various community, religious, and/or fraternal organizations.\n\nThe 30 acre grounds were fully irrigated and able to sustain a variety of non-indigenous plants. Historically, a stroll through the shaded, tree-lined cemetery pathways was meant to tap into all of the human senses in an almost transformative way. The Victorian people filled the landscape with symbols and material culture meant to convey a belief in everlasting life. These cemeteries were actually the forerunner of our American parks system.\n\nThe cemeteries of the Comstock are an exceptional and unique American West cultural landscape, and not the standard pioneer grid system graveyard often found in a transient mining town. What one sees here today is a powerful tool in our collective memory and a reflection of the population’s sense of place-a link back to their homelands. The cemeteries are an expression of ideology and belief, as well as a socially infused presentation of material culture.\n\nSilver Terrace cemeteries were once described as the loveliest burials grounds in the state of Nevada. Today they are victims of decay and abuse. Nearly eighty percent of the grave markers have been stolen or vandalized. In 2005, such theft became a felony in the state and this site is monitored remotely twenty-four hours a day, greatly improving our protection efforts. \n\nThe Comstock Cemetery Foundation relies on public support for cemetery preservation. There is no entrance fee, but donations are greatly appreciated. There is a donation tube outside the gates and additional information is available at the Comstock History Center", "photos": [{"photo_id": 289604, "filename": "289604.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "October 20, 2014, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Silver Terrace Cemeteries Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 289607, "filename": "289607.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "October 20, 2014, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Silver Terrace Cemeteries Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 289610, "filename": "289610.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "October 20, 2014, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Silver Terrace Cemeteries Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 289611, "filename": "289611.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "October 20, 2014, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": "Lady on Memorial Day, 1890c.

The gold and silver deposits that became known as the Comstock Lode were discovered in the spring of 1859 by two groups of placer miners at the head of what was later called Gold Canyon. Henry T.P. Comstock claimed ownership of the ground where the discovery was made hence his name was attached to this body of ore. The find brought the California miners back over the Sierras to settle and eventually grow a community that became known as the “Richest Place on Earth”. An industrial community, it consisted of every sort of business you could find in any major city of this size today. Schools, churches, saloons, restaurants, hotels, grocers, butchers, jewelers, gun dealers, lumber yards, hardware stores, undertakers, stock brokers, newspapers, clothiers, photographers, builders and masons and, of course brothels and a railroad. Truly a thriving community that was driven by the mines and mill of the area. Production from the mines during the period 1860 through 1910 was well over $400 million dollars in gold and silver. Calculated into today’s dollars it equates to nearly twenty billion dollars. A stock exchange was connected by telegraph to the San Francisco exchange and on to New York via Denver and Chicago. The mines of the Comstock became a major investment option for investors both in the new United States as well as Europe.\n\nRetail business was prolific in the community. You could buy most of the essentials for daily life in well stocked clothing stores, hardwares, lumber, stoves, paints; or be buried by any one of several undertakers. Life was hard and death came early from the likes of Pneumonia, TB, Cholera, mining and industrial accidents, or any other number of maladies. There were two hospitals to serve the community as well as numerous doctors and many lawyers to tend to your legal needs.\n\nLife on the Comstock was difficult, especially if you compare it to our current lifestyle. Miners worked underground in the mines on 12 hour shifts. They did not have fancy work clothes or protective equipment. Working in temperatures as much as 120 degrees, due to the hot water in the mines, they earned up to $4.00 per day which made them the highest paid miners in the world at the time. Living facilities for the single miners was generally a rooming or boarding house. The structures were not well insulated and the walls often consisted of nothing more than canvass or cloth of some type to separate the sleeping areas. Miners would only rent the rooms for a twelve hour period as the guy on the opposite shift would rent it for sleeping for the other twelve hours. As time went on many miners and mill workers either brought families with them to the area or acquired their family while working here on the Comstock. Meals in a small restaurant or “chop house” (their form of fast food) would be about .25 cents. They did not have nice warm boots, or heavy coats, or hard hats in the early days. Winters were much tougher than they are today and the summers were hot with no air conditioning. It was noisy, dirty, muddy, cold, or hot, the streets were constantly clogged with wagons, horses, people and mules. The milling operations put up such a din of noise that it was often difficult to talk in normal tones. The mills pounding and the underground explosions often created a ground vibration. \n\nFreighting and stage lines provided much of the early food and products needed to keep a large community moving along. Meats from the Dayton and Washoe Valleys and veggies from the Truckee Meadows. The finer things in life such as furniture, clothing, other food products, alcohol, shoes, hardware, metal products, etc. were freighted in by wagon and teams from all direction, primarily San Francisco. \n \nIn 1869 the Virginia & Truckee Railroad was completed from Carson City to Virginia City….and later on to Reno and south to Minden. The V&T operated from 1869 to 1950. Meeting up with the Central Pacific RR in Reno. The V&T was primarily built to haul ore from the Comstock to mills along the Carson Rivers south of Virginia City thus reducing the cost of milling the ores. The V&T was of great benefit to the Comstock region. Owned by Wm Ralston (the Bank of California), Wm. Sharon and D.O. Mills, it was highly profitable for many years. \n\nIt ran 21 miles into Carson City and 52 miles in to Reno. The Geiger Grade, now the main highway from Virginia City to Reno, which was crowded with many-muled freight wagons and stages became easily passable. The V&T could transport freight and passengers between Virginia City and San Francisco in a speedy 12 to 16 hours bringing all the fine goods of the east and Europe to sophiscated Virginia City. Weather was an ever present problem for the railroad, particularly in the winter when the snows came. Locomotives often became de-railed which necessitated digging them out and righting them onto the tracks. The railroad was a vital link to the rest of the country for the Comstock. Passenger travel to the transcontinental RR in Reno provided access for travelers to San Francisco or to the eastern cities and coast to meet with ship transport to Europe. Many of the wealthier Comstock entrepreneurs would travel to Europe looking for investors.\n\nIt was really all about the mines and mills of the Comstock. The mine headframes and the mills were interspersed throughout the residential and business districts. There was no zoning, like we know it today. The mines used massive amounts of lumber to buttress the tunnels and stopes from which the ore was being removed. The wood came from the local hills initially and was later cut and milled in the Lake Tahoe area, sent to the valley below by water “V” flume then trucked to the Comstock either by freight or, later, by the V&T Railroad. Wood was also needed for building structures, generating steam to operate equipment, and heat homes and businesses. Coal was also transported to the Comstock by the V&T and was used extensively for many years. Specialized equipment used in the milling processes as well as the mining itself, was usually obtained from San Francisco which would have come by ship around “the horn” from the east and Europe. The mines were highly industrialized in complexity with large pumps that pumped millions of gallons of water out of the deep mines (as deep as 3,000 feet below the surface) so the mining could continue. Virginia City was the most important and productive mining camp in the world but the fortunes of the town and population rose and fell with the prosperity of the mines. As one time over 400 mining companies were operating (or pretending to operate) in the mining district. Their stocks were freely bought and sold on the three local exchanges as well as on national basis. For example the Ophir, with 1,400 feet of claim had 16,800 shares, the Gould and Curry had 4,800 shares and the Savage some 800 shares. The total market value of all Comstock mines at the height of the marker was $40 million dollars. San Francisco became somewhat dependent on the mines of the Comstock as their residents owned ten times more stock in the silver and gold mines of the Comstock than in the California mines.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 303489, "filename": "303489.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Life in Virginia City on the Comstock Lode Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 303490, "filename": "303490.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Life in Virginia City on the Comstock Lode Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 303491, "filename": "303491.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Life in Virginia City on the Comstock Lode Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 303492, "filename": "303492.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 508, "aspect": 2.01574803149606}, {"photo_id": 303493, "filename": "303493.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 914, "aspect": 1.12035010940919}, {"photo_id": 303494, "filename": "303494.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 936, "aspect": 1.09401709401709}, {"photo_id": 303495, "filename": "303495.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 805, "aspect": 1.27204968944099}, {"photo_id": 303496, "filename": "303496.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": "The V&T decorated for the Fourth of July cir. 1885", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 714, "aspect": 1.43417366946779}, {"photo_id": 303497, "filename": "303497.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": "A locomotive being dug out of the snow after being derailed by heavy snow on the tracks.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 597, "aspect": 1.71524288107203}, {"photo_id": 303498, "filename": "303498.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": "Milling equipment for processing the ore located in the California Pan Mill in Six Mile Canyon.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 636, "aspect": 1.61006289308176}, {"photo_id": 303499, "filename": "303499.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "September 29, 2014", "submitted": "March 21, 2015, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Photo Displayed on Marker", "subcaption": "The Bonner Shaft which was located on South D.

He departed Mission San Xavier del Bac near Tucson in October of 1775, and by late February of 1776, the Spanish-Franciscan friar had reached the Mohave villages located just south of this location on the banks of the Colorado River. Garcés was now traveling in areas never before seen by a non-Native American. \nRelying on Native American guides, he walked from village to village. The Mohave agreed to lead him to the Pacific coast along a route used for trade purposes. It was from this general location on March 4, 1776, accompanied by four natives, that Garcés left the banks of the Colorado and set out across the Mojave Desert. He reached Mission San Gabriel Archangel 20 days later. Upon his return, he again visited the Mohave villages in this vicinity in May of 1776. His route followed a much older prehistoric trail used to bring shells and other trade goods to the tribes of the desert and mountain west. On July 19, 1781, in a Quechan revolt against Spanish forces, Father Garcés was killed at La Purisima Concepción Mission near the Yuma Crossing. Padre Garcés' body was later interred in the Franciscan church of the Colegio de la Santa Cruz, Querétaro, Mexico. \n\"Greater love hath no man than this -- That a man lay down his life for his friends.\" \nExcerpts from Father Garcés' Diary:\n\"I proceeded three leagues on the course northwest with some turns to the west-northwest.

A post office was started late in 1905 and the camp soon had telegraph, telephone, utilities and businesses. Transport was to Tonopah and the railroad at Sodaville.The 1906 earthquake halted mining investment. As a result, most of the productive work here was done by lessees. The gold strikes were in ore and placer, and by 1909, there were 13 mines and 16 placers. Some of the operations were the Big Four, Litigation Hill Merger, Stray Dog, September Fraction, and White Caps. Hydraulic placering started in 1909. In 1938, dredging began, continuing for years.

They started extensive placer operations at the Beard discovery site, later called Old Town, to differentiate it from the main camp two miles distant on Mount Blitzen.Estimates of silver and gold production during the camp's lifetime, 1867-1915, ranged from 10 million to 40 million. Principal silver mines were the Navajo, Belle Isle, Argenta, Commonwealth and Grand Prize.

Skilled stone masons quarried Rhyolitic tuff from nearby outcrops. The blocks were carefully dressed, then joined with mud and lime mortar. A third kiln was originally located to the west of the two remaining structures. The Panaca Summit Kilns were used until the late 1890's, when the mills at Bullionville closed. \n\nLocal silver ore processing required large quantities of fuel. Since charcoal burned twice as hot as cordwood and was more economical to transport, it became the preferred fuel for smelting. Swiss and Italian woodcutters, known as \"Carbonari\", had perfected the charcoal-making process in Europe. They brought these skills to the mining regions of Nevada in the mid-19th century. \"Billets\" or five foot lengths of wood were cut from the trunks and branches of pinon pine, juniper or mountain mahoghany. These were hauled to the kiln site and stacked in two vertical tiers within the ovens. Dry grasses and kindling were stuffed into the central \"chimney\" of the wood stack and ignited with live coals. Openings around the base of the kiln regulated the air flow, creating a steady fire; the vent at the top of the kiln was plugged to slow and control the burning rate. The carbonari would carefully oversee the combustion of the stack, which required up to 30 days to complete. The charcoal was allowed to cool for a week, then the kiln carefully opened on a calm day. Spontaneous fires during the opening could quickly destroy the contents of the kiln. Each kiln held over 50 cords and would produce an average of 30 bushels of charcoal per cord, enough to smelt one ton of silver ore. The Carbonari received very modest payments for their labors, with most of the profits pocketed by the teamsters and middlemen who delivered the charcoal to the mills.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 332652, "filename": "332652.jpeg", "photographer": "Trev Meed", "taken": "April 12, 2009", "submitted": "October 8, 2015, by Trev Meed of Round Mountain, Nevada.", "caption": "Panaca Summit Charcoal Kilns Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 449, "height": 586, "aspect": 0.766211604095563}, {"photo_id": 333165, "filename": "333165.jpeg", "photographer": "Trev Meed", "taken": "Circa 2013", "submitted": "October 11, 2015, by Trev Meed of Round Mountain, Nevada.", "caption": "Panaca Summit Charcoal Kilns and Marker", "subcaption": "The marker can be seen in the lower left-hand portion of the photograph, just above the wooden fence post.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 926, "height": 648, "aspect": 1.42901234567901}, {"photo_id": 332881, "filename": "332881.jpeg", "photographer": "Trev Meed", "taken": "April 12, 2009", "submitted": "October 9, 2015, by Trev Meed of Round Mountain, Nevada.", "caption": "Panaca Summit Charcoal Kilns", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 692, "height": 519, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 332877, "filename": "332877.jpeg", "photographer": "Trev Meed", "taken": "April 12, 2009", "submitted": "October 9, 2015, by Trev Meed of Round Mountain, Nevada.", "caption": "Panaca Summit Road Sign", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 623, "height": 467, "aspect": 1.33404710920771}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.17075, 37.81306]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 89436, "number": "125", "title": "Twelve Mile House", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Park System- Carson Valley Historical Society.", "address": null, "city": "Gardnerville", "subcity": null, "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 395N south of Riverview Drive, on the right when traveling south.

It was at this spot at Middlegate that in 1859 the Overland Stage & Freight Company built a station to serve the gold and silver mines near Tonopah and east to Ely. When the Pony Express began service on April 3, 1860 Middlegate station served as a changing station on the route for 18 months until October 24, 1861 when the completion of the Pacific Telegraph line ended the need for its existence. Middlegate continued to serve as a stage and freight station until the early 1900's to deliver personnel and much needed supplies to the gold and silver mines in eastern Nevada until the mines closed. Automobiles soon came into service and the Lincoln Highway replaced the long and uncomfortable stage routes.

In February 1858 he made a claim on a ledge of rock on the east side of Sun Mountain, filling out a location notice and hiding it in a crevice. This claim would be called the \"Virginia Lead\", a large vein near what would later become the \"Comstock Lode\". \"Old Virginny\" later sold his interests to the claim for an old horse, a pair of blankets, and a bottle of whiskey.\n\nIn June of 1859 the \"Ophir Bonanza\" was discovered by two Irish miners; Patrick McLaughlin and Peter O'Riley. This major discovery is recognized as the origin of the \"Comstock Lode\". \"Old Virginny\" would sell any claim he may have had in the discovery for $50.00.

He enlarged the cave and built a stone cabin in front of the opening. The mound actually formed the back wall and part of the sides of the cabin. Longstreet and his second wife, Susie, lived at the house for about five years (1895-1899).\n\nIn 1984 a flash flood reduced Jack's cabin to rubble. Historic restoration experts painstakingly set each stone back in its original position based on photos taken early in the last century. Restoration concluded in 2006.\n\nPhoto Captions:\nConcrete block coated with a sandy lime plaster replicates the spring mound that supported the cabin's back wall. This small cave opened into the lower spring mound providing a trickle of water. In addition to drinking water, Jack also stored perishable food in this naturally cool spot.\n\nLongstreet epitomizes the mythical western frontiersman: Self-reliant, independent and fair-minded. Speaking with a southern drawl, he was quick with a pistol and never missed his mark. As his skill with a gun grew so did his reputation as a dangerous man.

As you read this storyboard you are facing east toward Brunswick Canyon. The City of Empire was located to your right about 1/4 - 1/2 mile. At one time Empire City stretched for 3/4 of a mile and had a peak population of 700 people. Located on the Carson River, it got its nickname, Seaport, because the river was used to ship timber here from Alpine County. Previously the timber had been hauled over the mountains. The town milled lumber, most of which was used in the underground labyrinth of the Comstock Lode. The primary ore that was milled here was silver and gold bearing quartz rock. A seven-mile portion of the river was dotted with mills and settlements from the Mexican Mill to the south, in Empire, to the Eureka Mill at the far eastern end of Brunswick Canyon toward Dayton. Of these mills in the Empire area, the most famous one was Gregory's Mill which was built in 1859. this mill produced an average of 15,000 feet of lumber a day, and was the first steam powered mill in the Western Utah Territory. Nevada achieved Statehood, October 31, 1864. The main ore mill was the Mexican Mill which was built in 1861. It was water and steam powered. The Mexican Ditch was created to divert water from the Carson River to run the mill. The Mexican Mill processed 75 tons a day, had its own wood ranch and employed nine people; it occupied a portion of what is now the Empire Golf Course. In 1885, it was closed down. There were also two other main mills. They were the Mead and Morgan Mills and they were both water powered. The Mead Mill, built in 1861, employed 16 men and processed 20 tons a day. The Morgan Mill processed 80 tons a day. Serving some of the mills was the Virginia & Truckee Railroad whose tracks were immediately to the south along Morgan Mill Road. By 1878, the mills had closed down one by one. No one currently lives in Brunswick Canyon which the Carson River flows through, but the Empire City area now has a variety of homes and businesses.There are approximately 200 people buried in Empire Cemetery. The people buried here had an assortment of occupations such as: Laborers in the mills, shopkeepers, blacksmiths, carpenters, cooks, feeders, masons, real estate agents and amalgamators. Not all of the people here made it to adulthood as there are many children buried here. Also interned is a Vietnam Veteran who died serving his country.Boy Scouts of America have been active at this site. Three Eagle Scout projects have helped to restore this cemetery.

This engineering feat would transport up to 300 cords a day from the mill located in what is now Mill Creek.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 351056, "filename": "351056.jpeg", "photographer": "Alvis Hendley", "taken": "February 28, 2008", "submitted": "April 28, 2016, by Alvis Hendley of San Francisco, California.", "caption": "The Great Incline of the Sierra Nevada Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 800, "height": 616, "aspect": 1.2987012987013}, {"photo_id": 351057, "filename": "351057.jpeg", "photographer": "Alvis Hendley", "taken": "February 28, 2008", "submitted": "April 28, 2016, by Alvis Hendley of San Francisco, California.", "caption": "The Great Incline of the Sierra Nevada Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 711, "height": 800, "aspect": 0.88875}, {"photo_id": 687961, "filename": "687961.jpeg", "photographer": "Alvis Hendley", "taken": "October 22, 2022", "submitted": "November 5, 2022, by Alvis Hendley of San Francisco, California.", "caption": "Marker Relocated", "subcaption": "Sometime between 2008 and 2022, the marker was moved from private property to the public right-of-way.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 800, "height": 567, "aspect": 1.41093474426808}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.92875, 39.23672]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 94431, "number": null, "title": "The Reno Arch", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2003, "erected_by": "Historical Resources Commission", "address": null, "city": "Reno", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Lake Street, on the right when traveling north.

Electric bulbs spelled our \"Reno\" and \"Nevada's Transcontinental Highways Exposition, June 25 - Aug 1 1927.\" Following the event a contest was held by the City Council to find a slogan for the arch. In 1929 a Sacramento man won $100 for his entry, \"Reno, the biggest little city in the world.\" By 1934 some citizens felt that the slogan was passé, so it was eliminated and replaced with \"Reno\" in green neon. The change was not well accepted. In 1935 the slogan returned with redesigned neon lettering. The arch remained there unaltered until 1963 when it was replaced by a new one. The old arch first moved to the original site of the exposition, Idlewild Park and then to Paradise Park. In 1988, due to its badly deteriorated base, officials placed it in storage.\n\nIn 1994 filmmakers paid for the restoration and installation or the arch on East Fourth Street for its \"supporting role\" in the movie Cobb. After the filming, the Reno City Council launched a campaign to find a permanent home. Reconstructed here in 1995 the arch once again proudly welcomes visitors to downtown Reno.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 351486, "filename": "351486.jpeg", "photographer": "Alvis Hendley", "taken": "March 18, 2016", "submitted": "May 4, 2016, by Alvis Hendley of San Francisco, California.", "caption": "The Reno Arch Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 800, "height": 530, "aspect": 1.50943396226415}, {"photo_id": 762949, "filename": "762949.jpeg", "photographer": "Flexible Fotography", "taken": "May 19, 2012", "submitted": "November 30, 2023, by Flexible Fotography of San Diego, California.", "caption": "The Reno Arch Marker", "subcaption": "second plaque", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 754, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.736328125}, {"photo_id": 351487, "filename": "351487.jpeg", "photographer": "Alvis Hendley", "taken": "March 18, 2016", "submitted": "May 4, 2016, by Alvis Hendley of San Francisco, California.", "caption": "The Reno Arch", "subcaption": "The marker is mounted to the left of this view at the base of the arch.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 800, "height": 644, "aspect": 1.24223602484472}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.8098, 39.52567]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 94432, "number": "267", "title": "Galena Creek Fish Hatchery", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada Historic Preservation Office; Washoe County Regional Parks and Open Space; Nevada Commission for Cultural Affairs; Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund", "address": "18250 Mount Rose Highway", "city": "Reno", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Mount Rose Highway.

The Wedding Cake). \nThis year's theme introduced an armada of nautical artcars & imagery that floats to this day. \nFlaming dust tornados spin out of the Lighthouse as the Man burns; a Native American tradition honors them as ancestors.

A few who got lost in last year's maze claimed to have stumbled out of this year's maze - finding themselves in the future! And pretty bummed they had missed last year's burn. That's their story, anyhow. \nMy prediction of BRC of Tomorrow, alas, has yet to come true.

A Phoenix, crafted from the remains of the Man, is placed on the face of the New Man to signify re-birth. \n\n\n  Year of the Man 23 \n2008  \nHeight of Man: 40 Feet! \nHeight of Pedestal: 50 feet \nLocation: Black Rock Desert, NV \nParticipants: 49,599  \nTheme: The American Dream \nStunning views of BRC were provided from this 50ft obelisk, this year's Man base. It was bedecked with the flags of all nations, except the U.S. 'Cuz we burned them all! BAAHAHAHA! No, we didn't -- I'm just horsin' around. (See Year 1.)

But no whining. \nPopulation dipped down of the 1st time -- will that ever happen again?? \n\n  Year of the Man 25 \n2010  \nHeight of Man: 40 Feet! \nHeight of Pedestal: 50 feet \nLocation: Black Rock Desert, NV \nParticipants: 51,525  \nTheme: Metropolis: The Life of Cities  \nThe giant art deco building the Man stood upon was either 50 or 60 ft tall, depending on sources. I'm gonna go with 50, but let's have a show of hands. Um -- really? 60? Dang, but I just printed this... \nLarry may have had a highfalutin meaning to the theme, but many chose instead to make cheeky references to Fritz Lang's 1927 masterpiece Metropolis. \n\n  Year of the Man 26 \n2011  \nHeight of Man: 40 Feet! \nHeight of Pedestal: 64 feet sez wikipedia\nLocation: Black Rock Desert, NV \nParticipants: 53.963  \nTheme: Rites of Passage \nThe Man takes a walk! For the first time, he's not standing so stiff and all serious-like. I mean, he's a fun guy, likes to get about and check out the scene. \n(Notice I didn't say anything about his erection? Trying not to work blue.) \nTwo notes: the weather was really the best, couldn't ask for anything better. And -- for the first time -- the event sold out. On July 24th even. Quite a change from 2009, when attendance dropped. \n\n\n  Year of the Man 27 \n2012  \nHeight of Man: 40 Feet! \nHeight of Pedestal: 50 feet? Yep! \nLocation: Black Rock Desert, NV \nParticipants: 56,149  \nTheme: Fertility 2.0 \nInside the Man were a lot of Little Men, no royalty paid to the estate of Louisa May Alcott. A lot of amazing art particularly the Pier 2. \nAfter putting on glasses, realized theme was not Futility 2.0, and I drew this -- \n\n  Year of the Man 28 \n2013  \nHeight of Man: 50 Feet?

Will your head feel like a cargo container? \n\n  Year of the Man 29 \n2014  \nHeight of Man: 105 Feet! \nHeight of Pedestal: No Pedestal! \nLocation: Black Rock Desert, NV \nParticipants: 65,922  \nTheme: Caravansary \nThe Man was absolutely colossal! However, due to lack of radiation, he did not come to life to menace Hoover Dam. A disappointment. Happily, Duke Ellington's classic Caravan was frequently played. \n\n  Year of the Man 30 \n2015  \nHeight of Man: 60 Feet! \nHeight of Pedestal: 9 feet ,apparently  \nLocation: Black Rock Desert, NV \nParticipants: 67,564  \nTheme: Carnival of Mirrors \nMirrors, masks, mazes, merger, magic, my oh my.

Look, just have a good time and mention Lorenzo de Medici once in a while, you'll be fine. \nAnd now, its time to stop reading this nonsense and enjoy some horsing around. \n\n  The Man Krewe \n(1997 - 2014)  \n\nAh well things do change. For many years, many great artists built the Man. But with last year's 105' Big Man, and its design change, I regret to inform y'all - The Man Krewe hath been disbanded. They had a grand party, a fine wake, & probably several drinks. And they are around the Playa, doing great art elsewhere. The Man will continue, but without this fine Krewe. I conclude with a embellishment to an old saying \"Law and Burning Man are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.\" ", "photos": [{"photo_id": 361949, "filename": "361949.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 30, 2016", "submitted": "September 8, 2016, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Burning Man Timeline, 1986 -

As you drive and look at the area, think about those people who plodded along day after day, through the thick alkali dust – headed toward dreams of gold or a new life. \n\nThe California Trail had its beginnings at several points along the Missouri River, and included several variant routes across the Great Basin and over the Sierra Nevada Mountains into California. With the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, most travelers made the journey by rail.  \n\nYou’re Invited!\n\nThere are many California Trail sites like this one spread across Nevada.

Mining bonanzas in the southern deserts set a plan afoot to bring ore and new profits to the Comstock. A mining railroad starting from the V&T in Mound House would go all the way to the Colorado River in Arizona — the Carson & Colorado Railroad.\n\nRails passed through Dayton in November 1880, in 1881 the first depot was erected at Dayton. Mining developments then drew the railroad from Colorado to Owens Valley ending at Deeler, California in July 1883. Rail traffic boomed in the 1880’s but by 1900 profits declined and the line was sold. Unfortunately for Dayton, in 1905 the “Hazen Cutoff” was put through to the Transcontinental Railroad and the line from Churchill to Mound House was bypassed. Various segments were abandoned over the years with the last remnant in the Owens Valley running until 1960.\n\nUse of the Dayton Depot diminished after the 1905 bypass and the line through Dayton was completely abandoned in 1934. The depot was converted to a private residence and in the 1950’s it was moved to the corner with Main St. to make way for Hwy 50E. Lyon County purchased the depot in 2007 using federal highway funds won by the Historical Society of Dayton Valley, which also became the steward of the depot.

Numerous other veins were found and exploited, with millions of dollars of silver and gold taken out of the hills. Veins were followed underground, and eventually many of the mines were connected to each other through vast tunnel systems. \n\nEven so, not every vein was located or mined. Near this spot, several silver veins break the surface, but were never exploited during the mining boom of the early twentieth century. These veins, though small, are a reminder of the work of thousands of men who searched for and mined the precious metals in some inhospitable areas of the desert, and in the process created many communities which continue to be a part of Nevada today.\n\nDedicated this 15th day of September, 2013\nBy the Queho Posse Chapter 1919 of the Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus In Conjunction with the Tonopah Historic Mining Park and the Tonopah Town Board", "photos": [{"photo_id": 394761, "filename": "394761.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "January 4, 2013", "submitted": "August 17, 2017.", "caption": "Silver Vein Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 800, "height": 600, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 394762, "filename": "394762.png", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "August 17, 2017.", "caption": "Silver Vein Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 773, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7548828125}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.22671, 38.06987]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 111191, "number": null, "title": "Heroes of Hoover", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation", "address": "81 Hoover Dam Access Road", "city": "Boulder City", "subcity": null, "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Hoover Dam Access Road, on the left when traveling north.

In 1961 the store was converted into a club that was the first coffeehouse in Las Vegas and a popular hangout among local college students. The Red Barn hosted straight patrons during the day, but after midnight it catered to the gay community. By 1972 it was exclusively a gay club, one of only a few in Las Vegas.\n\nJudy Bayley, co-owner of the Hacienda Hotel and Daydream dude ranch, hosted charity gay hayrides from ranch to the Red Barn…\"everybody'd show up and was usually bombed outta their mind. To see some of these guys on a horse that'd never been on a horse was hysterical! I would be a wrangler on those rides (and) I ended up pulling some rescues. \n\nThe Red Barn offered popular drag shows such as Fabulous Fakes and RB Follies, and it provided a place for the gay community to socialize. The club also published the \"RB Bag,\" one of the earlies gay magazines in Southern Nevada.\n\nThe Red Barn closed in March 1988, and the abandoned building burned down later that year. The only remaining piece of the renowned property is its neon martini class signage, whichvis now part of the Neon Museum's collection.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 410526, "filename": "410526.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "November 13, 2017", "submitted": "January 1, 2018, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "The Red Barn Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 410527, "filename": "410527.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "November 13, 2017", "submitted": "January 1, 2018, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "The Red Barn Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 410529, "filename": "410529.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "November 13, 2017", "submitted": "January 1, 2018, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "The Red Barn Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 410531, "filename": "410531.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "November 13, 2017", "submitted": "January 1, 2018, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "The Red Barn Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.16946, 36.12639]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 113027, "number": "13-A", "title": "Emigrant Trail--Truckee River Route", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1974, "erected_by": "Nevada Emigrant Trail Committee, Nevada Historical Society, Trails West Inc.", "address": null, "city": "Reno", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on East Peckham Lane east of Coliseum Way, on the right when traveling east.

From Sacramento the Central Pacific Railroad was extended eastward over Sierra Nevada range and along the Truckee River Canyon to approach Lake's crossing (near here). By offering land in exchange for the placement of a depot station, Myron Lake convinced railroad officials to build the main station for the Truckee Meadows near his bridge crossing. In 1868, the railroad auctioned 400 town lots and within a month more than 100 houses and businesses were established - the city of Reno was born.\n\nIn 1869, construction started on a regional railroad, called the Virginia and Truckee (V&T); that would connect the Comstock to Reno and eventually extend its lines south to Carson City to transport products from the dairy trade from Carson Valley to Reno and on to San Francisco.\n\nAmerica Goes Mobile\nDuring the 1910s and 1920s, highways were built so people could drive in their new automobiles across the country. At the same time, Reno became famous for quick divorces and easy marriages. In 1913, a private consortium led by Carl G. Fisher decided to build the transcontinental Lincoln Highway from New York to San Francisco. Reno and Carson City became important junctions along the highway which would become (U.S. 50).\n\nConstructed 1925, the Victory Highway (U.S. 40) ran from Reno through the Truckee Canyon over the Sierra Nevada range and into Sacramento.\n\nReno has served as a commercial redistribution point for Western manufacturers and distributors for the past 120 years. Today, Reno's convenient location and transportation routes have spurred the warehousing and logistic industries, which continue to be the underlying current of economic development in the region.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 413378, "filename": "413378.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "December 14, 2013", "submitted": "January 19, 2018, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "Reno at the Crossroads Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 413379, "filename": "413379.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "December 14, 2013", "submitted": "January 19, 2018, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "Reno at the Crossroads Marker", "subcaption": "A Western Pacific crew works its way through the Truckee River Canyon", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 413380, "filename": "413380.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "December 14, 2013", "submitted": "January 19, 2018, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "Reno at the Crossroads Marker", "subcaption": "The first concrete bridge on the Lincoln Highway that connected Reno with Sacramento over the Sierra Nevada.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 413381, "filename": "413381.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "December 14, 2013", "submitted": "January 19, 2018, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "Reno at the Crossroads Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 413382, "filename": "413382.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "December 14, 2013", "submitted": "January 19, 2018, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "original Reno Arch", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.8097, 39.52588]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 113756, "number": null, "title": "Site of Reno Air Mail Field", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Air Mail Pioneers Inc.", "address": null, "city": "Reno", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Plumas St, on the right when traveling south.

Today, it is one of the few unspoiled examples of the work of the craftsmen of the early 1900 era, and an example of the business life in the Tonopah-Goldfield area from the years when the mines were producing millions and bringing new prosperity to the state of Nevada.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 152737, "filename": "152737.jpeg", "photographer": "M H", "taken": "May 8, 2011", "submitted": "May 10, 2011, by Mh of Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "Southern Nevada Consolidated Telephone-Telegraph Company Building Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1020, "height": 765, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 152738, "filename": "152738.jpeg", "photographer": "M H", "taken": "May 8, 2011", "submitted": "May 10, 2011, by Mh of Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "Southern Nevada Consolidated Telephone-Telegraph Company Building and Marker", "subcaption": "Marker is mounted on the building to the left of the entrance door.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 152739, "filename": "152739.jpeg", "photographer": "M H", "taken": "May 8, 2011", "submitted": "May 10, 2011, by Mh of Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "The intersection of Ramsey Street and Columbia Avenue", "subcaption": "The Telegraph building is the small building on the left.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 617885, "filename": "617885.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "October 10, 2021", "submitted": "October 24, 2021, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Southern Nevada Consolidated Telephone-Telegraph Company Building Interior", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 480, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 617886, "filename": "617886.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "October 10, 2021", "submitted": "October 24, 2021, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Southern Nevada Consolidated Telephone-Telegraph Company Building Interior", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 480, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.23491, 37.70912]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 114320, "number": null, "title": "The Crystal Bar", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1992, "erected_by": "Julia C.

He told Boyer that the state did not have a right-of-way over the property. Boyer checked, and the state did not. Nicolaides told the state where he wanted the road to run past his station, and the state moved the route in return for a right-of-way.\n\nNicolaides named his new site Glendale because of the view from the hill behind his station. Joining similarly named places in 17 other states, it also led to his nickname, \"Glendale Nick.\" He sold his station in 1926, but it and the surrounding business continue to serve the traveling public nearly a century later.\n\nDedicated this 21st Day of September, 2014 by the Queho Posse Chapter 1919\nE Clampus Vitus", "photos": [{"photo_id": 418737, "filename": "418737.jpeg", "photographer": "Queho Posse Chapter 1919 E Clampus Vitus", "taken": "February 19, 2018", "submitted": "March 10, 2018.", "caption": "Glendale and \"Glendale Nick\" Nicolaides Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 694, "aspect": 1.47550432276657}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.56925, 36.66546]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 115733, "number": null, "title": "The New State of Nevada", "subtitle": "By the President of the United States of America", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2017, "erected_by": "Lucinda Jane Saunders Chapter #1881, Jesse Lee Reno Outpost #1422, Snowshoe Thompson Chapter #1827, Samuel L.

He made his brags on the day of his death, which was his 30th birthday, that he had killed 11 men, and was going to have the 12th one, me, for supper. ‘Shall I put your horse up Mr. Brown?’ He, in a very gruff manner said ‘No, you son-of-a-bitch, I have come to kill you!’ and at once drew his gun.”\n\nHenry Van Sickle, unarmed, fled into the saloon and through the dining hall to retrieve his shotgun. Sam pursued with his six-shooter cocked and in position, but Van’s station was full of men, causing chaos and confusion. Outnumbered, Sam fled southbound. Henry, knowing Sam would kill him the next time he got a chance, followed in hot pursuit.\n\nGun-fire and near misses ensued between Henry and Sam along a 10-mile stretch between Van’s and Lute Old’s station, including a shot that blew off Sam’s hat and burned his face. Sam first tried refuge at Mott’s Station and then made his way toward Lute Old’s station. But Henry was able to beat Sam and his injured horse there.\n\n“When stepping out I said, as he had previously said to me, ‘You son-of-a-bitch, I got you now!’ and at once ended his career, putting seven buckshots right through the center of his body. Death being instantaneous, he falling from his horse without muttering a word that could be distinguished from a groan, thus ended the life of a man that had few, if any redeeming traits to relieve a life of blackness and infamy.”\n\nUpon Henry’s insistence for vindication, there was an investigation and trial. On July 9, 1861, Henry Van Sickle was fully exonerated by a coroner’s jury. The official ruling of death: A just dispensation of an all-wise providence. At his own expense, Henry paid to have Samuel Brown ‘Well Buried.’\n\nDedicated on April 30, 2016 (6021) for the year 1971 (5976) by the Snowshoe Thompson Chapter #1827 of the Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus", "photos": [{"photo_id": 421595, "filename": "421595.jpeg", "photographer": "Snowshoe Thompson Chapter No. 1827 of the Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus", "taken": null, "submitted": "April 2, 2018, by Frank Gunshow Sanchez of Hollister, California.", "caption": "The Demise of Sam Brown Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 703, "height": 715, "aspect": 0.983216783216783}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.8381, 38.97281]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 115855, "number": "256", "title": "Historic Transportation From Honey Lake To Virginia City", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Sierra Pacific Power Company; Nevada Department of Transportation; State Historic Preservation Office; United States Bureau of Land Management", "address": null, "city": "Reno", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of N Virginia St and N Red Rock Rd, on the right when traveling west on N Virginia St. ", "missing": null, "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=115855", "description": "The historic road corridors from the Truckee Meadows northwestward into the Honey Lake area contains a tangle of intertwined routes following the course of valleys, portions of an emigrant trail cutoff, toll roads, county roads and casual parallel routes developed to bypass blockages such as mud holes. Construction of the paved precursor to U.S. 395 and recent freeway construction along this same corridor have obliterated much of the earlier road system, cutting it into isolated segments. The road is associated with the continuing history of transportation in the state of Nevada, reflecting the process of road improvement and economic and demographic change.\n\nHoney Lake 1856-1863\nIn 1856, the early settlers of the region, the Honey Lakers, proposed the territory of Nataqua, encompassing the land along the eastern Sierra from Susanville to Carson Valley. The 1859 silver strikes in the Comstock Lake generated a prosperous market for the ranchers' livestock and produce. Freight wagons and stagecoaches ran regularly over the rutted road from the Honey Lake area to Virginia City and strengthened the settlers' attachment to eastern Sierra settlements rather than those in California. The Honey Lake ranchers felt so strongly about their independence and connection to the Great Basin environs, they fought the 1863 Sagebrush War attempting to block their annexation to Plumas County, California.\n\nEmigrant Trail 1851-1855\nIn 1851, James Pierson Beckwourth (1798-1866), the son of Sir Jennings Beckwith and a slave, located and constructed a wagon road connecting the California Emigrant Trail in the Truckee Meadows to Marysville, California via Sierra Valley (portions of Highway 70). Beckwourth, a trapper and trader, hoped to earn his fortune with the opening of the road; however, he was never reimbursed as promised by the mayor or Marysville for road construction. The trail served for a few years as an alternative pass through the Sierra; it became a byway for local traffic after 1855.\n\nRoadside Stations and Ranches 1850s\nThis marker is located at the Peavine Ranch, an overnight stop for the travelers along the road from the Truckee River to ranches near Honey Lake. The ranch advertised a well-stocked table and bar and first class beds. Purchased in 1862 by Fielding Lemmon, it was initially part of real estate and mining promotion as platted on this 1867 map, but Peavine grew instead into a prosperous livestock operation. Several other ranches were located along the road, yet, for nearly a hundred years regional growth centered around downtown Reno and Sparks. Over time, most of the ranches and stage stops were replaced by small isolated communities, then larder communities, and eventually suburbs.\n\nHighway System 1930s-Present\nThe Three Flags Highway gave way to U.S. 395, which was an extension of Virginia Street in Reno. In the 1970s a four-lane system was proposed. The highway generally follows the same transportation corridor and still cuts through the Peavine Ranch property.\n\nThree Flags Highway 1923-1930s\nOne of the first federally funded highways in Nevada was a macadam road from Reno to the Nevada/California border. The Nevada Highway Commission was organized in 1917. Federal money was mandated for Nevada in 1921 and construction started in April 1922 for the Three Flags Highway, the road linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Portions of the road still remain.\n\nToll Roads 1850s-1860s\nPrior to state and federally constructed highways, a stage and toll road between Honey Lake and Virginia City was more or less maintained under a succession of private owners such as Myron C. Lake. In 1861, Lake traded property in Honey Lake Valley for the log toll bridge across the Truckee River with Charles W. Fuller of Susanville. Lake applied for a franchise to improve, maintain and construct a toll road from three miles south of this bridge to the California/Nevada border excluding passage through town streets of Reno.

From its humble beginnings in 1902 of only three small mining claims, also known as grubstakes, the town exploded and was the largest city in the state by 1907.\n\nThe biggest spike in population came between the spring of 1905 and the fall of 1906 when the population rose from 8,000 to 15,000. By 1907, Goldfield was home to 20,000 and spanned more than 50 city blocks.\n\nThe original tent camp, name Gran Pah, disappeared and was replaced with 49 saloons, 27 restaurants, 15 barbershops, 6 bakeries, 54 assayers, 84 attorneys, 162 brokers, 14 cigar stores, 21 grocers, 22 hotels, 17 laundries, 40 doctors, 2 undertakers, 4 schools, 3 railroads, 2 daily and 3 weekly newspapers.\n\nMore than $90 million in gold was produces here from 1901 through 1940, or about $2 billion at today's prices.\n\nBy 1910, mining production was declining and many property owners were dismantling their buildings and moving on or leaving the structures to the ravages of the desert. The city of 20,000 was no more, and a thriving community of about 5,000 remained. By 1920, the 5,000 dwindled to 1,500.\n\nBad things come in threes and so it was with Goldfield – production fell, and a flood struck the town in 1913. In 1923, a fire, caused by a bootlegger's exploding still, leveled 25 blocks. Goldfield couldn't bounce back, but it didn't completely disappear either.

The Nevada Department of Highways purchased the railroad rights-of-way for Highway 95 and the rails were torn up in 1919.\n\nThe Bullfrog Goldfield line was built south from Goldfield to Beatty and Rhyolite beginning in May 1906. The line closed in January 1928 but went through five management changes in its short life.\n\nThe Tonopah and Tidewater was built north from Ludlow, California to Gold Center and used the Bullfrog and Goldfield tracks to reach the then booming mining town. Construction began on the T&T in 1905 with an opening in October 1907. This line ran until June 14, 1940.\n\nIn all Goldfield had 5 railroads the 5th one was Goldfield Cons. Mining Co. RR and it ran from the mines to construction mill on Columbia mountain. The Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad has the longest run surviving until October 1947. It was preceded in its inception by separate lines for each city. The Tonopah line began in 1903, with the Goldfield line opening in 1904. The two lines consolidated November 1, 1905. In all the line serviced about 100 miles of tracks and about a dozen shops.\n\nThe railroad boom was fueled by gold production, with more than $90 million mined between 1901 and 1940. That's $2 billion by today's standards.\n\nThe Tonopah and Goldfield's northern reach to Mina served as a junction point with the Nevada and California Railroad, and affiliate line of the Southern Pacific. This enables passengers from the East or West coasts to travel to the northern end of Nevada and California spur line by fast Pullman service.

The Tonopah district was booming with miners who found more silver than gold.

In September of 1879 the platform burnt to the ground.\n\nAround the bottom of each oven are three rows of air vents. These were used to control the rate at which the wood would burn. During, the first 3 to 4 days the two lower rows were blocked off with rocks or bricks leaving the top row open. The smoke was watched to make sure the wood was burning at the desired rate. At first the smoke was white, almost steam-like in appearance. It would then change to yellow for 36 to 48 hours. The yellow smoke then changed to blue and was timed for 12 hours, at which time the top row of vents were closed and the second row of vents were opened. The process was then repeated, after which time the second row of vents were closed and the first row was opened. After this process was repeated one last time, all the vents were then sealed and the fire was allowed to extinguish itself. The oven remained sealed for approximately 3 days to insure the fire was completely out.\n\nOnce the kiln had cooled down, the doors were opened and the charcoal was removed by way of the lower opening.

For thousands of years, Ancient Lake Bonneville was contained by mountains acting as natural dams, occupying the lowest closed depression in the eastern Great Basin. The largest area covered by the lake was more than 20,000 square miles, about 325 miles long, 134 miles wide, with depths of just over 1,000 feet. During the existence of Ancient Lake Bonneville, the climate was somewhat wetter and colder than now. The lake was a freshwater lake, its sources coming from direct precipitation and melting glaciers. Once captured, the water remained in the lake, except for evaporation. As the lake expanded in size, it gradually spread over much of Utah and into Nevada and Idaho. At the edges of Ancient Lake Bonneville, waves and erosion cut shorelines in the naked rock, leaving behind terraces to mark its water levels. The shorelines are identified by a shelf or bench protruding from the mountainside, well above the valley floor. Four main terraces cut in the mountain rock can be observed. The Bonneville Terrace, Provo Terrace, and Stansbury Terrace each show the rise or fall of the lake surrounding West Wendover. The Stansbury shoreline is the oldest of these three terraces, dating over 30,000 years. The Bonneville Terrace is the highest, at just over 5,000 feet above sea level. Where you are standing now would be under approximately 530 feet of water. At this height, about 14,500 years ago, the lake broke through a natural earthen dam and spilled into a tributary of the Snake River at Red Rock Pass in southeast Idaho, discharging an immense volume of water which helped cut the Snake River. This event is known as the Bonneville Flood, which lowered the outlet and surface elevation of Ancient Lake Bonneville by over 350 feet. After the flood, Ancient Lake Bonneville carved out the Provo Shoreline Terrace of today, at just over 4,700 feet above sea level. Approximately 12,000 years ago, the level of Ancient Lake Bonneville fell sharply due to changes in the Great Basin climate. The fourth terrace, known as the Gilbert Terrace, was the last shoreline of the once great lake before retreating into what is today, the Great Salt Lake, located adjacent to Salt Lake City, Utah.\nGreat Salt Lake DesertThe Bonneville Salt Flats or the Great Salt Lake Desert was left behind when Ancient Lake Bonneville evaporated, leaving a vast concentration of salt and minerals. The flats are composed of potassium, magnesium, lithium, and sodium chloride (common table salt), ranging in thickness from less than one inch to six feet. The Salt Flats are one of the flattest areas on earth; the curvature of the earth can actually be observed from a viewpoint west of your current location. The 3,000-square-mile salt flats are 35 percent larger than any other salt bed worldwide. In the winter, a shallow layer of standing water covers the surface, giving it a mirror-like effect. Wind combines with water to create the flat surface. Once the water has evaporated, a dry, hard, salt surface remains. The white surface is always cool due to the reflective nature of the salt. As the sun’s light and heat rise from the blinding-white surface, shimmering mirages appear. The purest salt is hard as concrete when dry and makes the world’s best racing surface. Known as the greatest speedway in the world, for nearly a century it has been used to set records of speed and endurance. In 1910, Ab Jenkins traveled 60 M.P.H. on a Yale Motorcycle. Sixty years later, Gary Gabelich, in the Blue Flame jet-powered rocket car, produced a top speed of 622.40 M.P.H., a speed that stands as the fastest documented time on Bonneville. Each year, racers from around the world come to Bonneville to take on the salt. This annual event has taken place every August for more than 60 years.\nBonneville’s NameIn 1833, Joseph Reddeford Walker, explorer and frontiersman, mapped the area around the Great Salt Lake and crossed the northern perimeter of the Flats while in the employ of Captain Benjamin E. Bonneville, an officer in the U.S. Army. Although it is unlikely that Bonneville himself ever visited here, Ancient Lake Bonneville and the salt flats derive their name from him.\n(photo captions)\n• Ancient Lake Bonneville\n• Bonneville Sun Rise\n• Area mountains to the south\n• The Blue Flame Rocket Car", "photos": [{"photo_id": 467912, "filename": "467912.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 25, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Ancient Lake Bonneville Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "aspect": 1.51255539143279}, {"photo_id": 467945, "filename": "467945.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 910, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.888671875}, {"photo_id": 467946, "filename": "467946.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 472, "aspect": 2.16949152542373}, {"photo_id": 467947, "filename": "467947.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Ancient Lake Bonneville Marker (wide view; Bonneville Salt Flats in distant background right)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "aspect": 1.77777777777778}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.07308, 40.74075]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 131448, "number": null, "title": "Lincoln Highway", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": "1552 Wendover Boulevard", "city": "West Wendover", "subcity": null, "county": "Elko County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Wendover Boulevard west of North Gene L.

Asphalt and concrete roads were yet to come. To get from coast-to-coast, it was much easier to take the train. The Lincoln Highway Association conceived the first improved automobile road across the United States of America. Inspired by the Good Roads Movement, the Lincoln Highway ran from Time Square in New York City to Lincoln Park in San Francisco, traversing 14 states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California. This paved the way for the development of a nationwide highway network that is now unsurpassed. As the first automobile road across America, the Lincoln Highway brought great prosperity to hundreds of cities, towns, and villages along the way. The first officially recorded mileage in 1913 was 3,389 miles; by 1924 the road was improved and realigned, covering only 3,142 miles. A road was “improved” if it was just graded; few even had gravel in the early years of the association. One of the hardest fought realignments took place in the deserts of Utah, west of Salt Lake City. A new route, the Goodyear Cutoff, was surveyed, and prepared for construction by the Lincoln Highway Association. The Utah State government promoted a route directly west of Salt Lake City to Wendover, Nevada, as the route to San Francisco. This course crossed miles of salt desert, which was often submerged under water. The Wendover road, favored by Utah, was part of another named highway, the Victory Highway. Like the Lincoln, it claimed New York and San Francisco as its endpoints. Northern Californians favored the Victory for economic reasons; travelers along the Victory would almost certainly end their trips in San Francisco.\nLincoln Highway MarkersThe association ceased activity at the end of 1927. Its last major activity was to mark the highway not as a route from one destination to another, but as a memorial to President Abraham Lincoln, the roads namesake. On September 1, 1928, thousands of Boy Scouts fanned out along the highway. At an average of about one monument per mile, 3,000 concrete markers were installed with a small bust of Lincoln and the inscription, “This highway dedicated to Abraham Lincoln,” were placed along the road from New York City to San Francisco.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 467915, "filename": "467915.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 25, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Lincoln Highway Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 674, "aspect": 1.51928783382789}, {"photo_id": 467951, "filename": "467951.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Nearby Lincoln Highway Marker Replica", "subcaption": "This replica of the original Commemorative Marker is located one mile east, on the north side of Wendover Boulevard, not far from the Utah-Nevada state line.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 731, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7138671875}, {"photo_id": 467953, "filename": "467953.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Lincoln Highway Marker (wide view; Wendover Boulevard in background)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 760, "aspect": 1.34736842105263}, {"photo_id": 467952, "filename": "467952.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 250, "aspect": 4.096}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.07287, 40.74071]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 131450, "number": null, "title": "The Victory Highway", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": "1552 Wendover Boulevard", "city": "West Wendover", "subcity": null, "county": "Elko County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Wendover Boulevard west of North Gene L.

Original eagle markers were to be located at each county line with a plaque dedicated to the sons and daughters who served their country in World War I, sacrificing their lives for our freedom. Only five original bronze eagles are known to be in existence, two in Kansas and three in California. The Victory Highway is a near-forgotten relic of the early 20th century roadways, a path traversed by early auto-pioneers from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. The road you are standing on today was completed in 1925 and used until the 1940s. Highway U.S. 40 replaced the Victory Highway to the south, which is now known as Wendover Boulevard. The arch represents the Victory Highway sign, used at the only documented official ceremony opening the Victory Highway. The ceremony took place on June 25, 1925, just east of Wendover on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Officiating were Utah Governor George Dern, Nevada Governor James Scrugham, and Secretary of Agriculture William Jardine.\nAssociation IncorporatedThe Victory Highway Association incorporated in Topeka, Kansas, late in 1921 to locate and mark a transcontinental highway. Victory Highway, dedicated to American Forces who died in World War I, traversed the United States from New York City to San Francisco. In 1925, the transcontinental route offered a panorama of the mid-section of the country that epitomizes the western expansion of the Nation from Colonial days to the present time. For 3,205 miles, this great motorway follows the same course, or one closely parallel, as that of the earliest settlers of the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri valleys, crossing 14 states in all. Less than 14 per cent or 788 miles of the highway was unimproved.\nFrom Salt Lake City, the Victory Highway skirts around Great Salt Lake over the famous Wendover Cutoff. The crossing of the salt flats between Salt Lake City and Wendover on the Utah/Nevada border was costly, involving five years of labor. The remarkable engineering feat bridged what was once a great obstacle to transcontinental motor travel, the Bonneville Salt Flats. This accomplishment blazed a new auto-route across northern Nevada to Reno, parallel to the Lincoln Highway to the south. In the early to mid-twenties, only 81 miles of the 371 miles of the Victory Highway across Utah were paved, 107 miles consisted of gravel surfacing, and 183 miles were relatively unimproved. The Victory Highway was designated Route No. 40 by state and federal highway officials shortly after the Wendover Cutoff was completed, and the Victory Highway was used until it was replaced in the 1940s.\nAn original culvert to the east of this marker still exists today. When a newer portion of Highway 40 was constructed in the 1940s, this section of the Victory Highway, along with culverts, was left intact. Constructed of stone and galvanized steel, these culverts are a testament to the skills of road engineers and rock masons of the early 19th century.\nFederal HighwayIn 1921, the federal government passed the Federal Highway Act of 1921. A similar act, passed in 1916, provided matching funds to the states for highway construction. Unlike the 1916 act, the 1921 act required the states to identify seven percent of its total mileage as “primary”; only these roads would be eligible for federal funds. In the ten years prior to the 1921 act, the United States went from having one named highway to having an unorganized and confusing system of multiple-named highways. As a result, a numbered highway system was formed to organize the national highways across the United States. In most states, the Lincoln Highway was the obvious choice as a federal road, but there were a few exceptions, the greatest challenge being Utah. Despite numerous reports and heavy lobbying by the Lincoln Highway Association, the federal government selected the Wendover route or “Victory Highway” (Route No. 40) as the federal road across Utah and Nevada.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 467918, "filename": "467918.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 25, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "The Victory Highway Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 467961, "filename": "467961.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 959, "height": 747, "aspect": 1.28380187416332}, {"photo_id": 467962, "filename": "467962.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "The Victory Highway Marker (wide view; Wendover Boulevard in background)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 767, "aspect": 1.33507170795306}, {"photo_id": 467963, "filename": "467963.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 247, "aspect": 4.14574898785425}, {"photo_id": 467965, "filename": "467965.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "The Victory Highway Arch & Monument (located beside this marker)", "subcaption": "inscription on plaque", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 582, "aspect": 1.75945017182131}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.07281, 40.7407]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 131451, "number": null, "title": "Historic Wendover Field", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": "1552 Wendover Boulevard", "city": "West Wendover", "subcity": null, "county": "Elko County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Wendover Boulevard west of North Gene L.

Though isolated, the area was well suited to fit the needs: the Western Pacific Railroad served the area; the land for the airfield was located near virtually uninhabited areas of the Great Salt Lake Desert in western Utah and eastern Nevada; the generally excellent year-round flying weather allowed safe and frequent training flights for aircraft. The actual selection of the site and construction of runways and building began in 1940. In September 1940, the Department of the Interior transferred over 1.5 million acres of land to the Army Air Corps. Additional acquisitions brought the total land area to over 3 million acres, ultimately making the Wendover facility the world’s largest and finest bombing and gunnery range. The first military personnel arrived in August 1941. With the entrance of the United States into World War II, December 8, 1941, the installation became home to more than 20,000 personnel\nTokio TrolleyWith the heavy bomber came the need to train the gunnery crews for needed aerial defense. An advanced training device was built north of the airfield to accommodate this necessity, which was nicknamed the “Tokio Trolley.” (T-o-k-i-o is the correct spelling.) This facility was a main part of the gunnery range and included over 60 buildings for operation and storage. The facility was built with various matching gun ranges which allowed gunners to first train from stationary emplacements at stationary targets; then from stationary emplacement at moving targets; and finally, the most difficult but the most realistic with regard to actual air combat, from a moving emplacement to a moving target. This final stage was accomplished by firing the mounted .50 caliber guns on a moving rail car along a section of track at up to 40 miles per hour while at the same time trying to hit moving targets, which were mounted atop moving (yet unmanned) jeeps guided by paved and wooden tracks located on the inside of the target berms. General Douglas McArthur voiced his praise by saying, “Wendover gunners were the best trained in the army.” After World War II, the facilities were removed, and all that remain today are the firing pits, berms, some concrete foundations, and stationary concrete firing platforms.\n\nBomb Groups\nTwenty-two heavy bomber crews train at Wendover Army Air Field Base before being assigned overseas.

However, the Wendover training was abruptly canceled in September of that same year. The fighters were transferred out to make room for a group of Boeing B-29 Superfortresses.\n\nThe 509th Composite GroupThe 509th Composite Group began forming in Wendover in September of 1944 and was commanded by then, Colonel Paul W. Tibbets. The unit was completely self-contained, outfitted with the latest B-29 Heavy Bombers; its own logistics, including land and air transports; its own security and FBI details; and specific hand-picked crews and soldiers. Anything that was needed from men to materials simply required Colonel Tibbets to use the code name, “Silver Plate,” which had been provided to him by General “Hap” Arnold, Chief to the U.S. Army Air Forces. This code overrode any other military orders with regard to operations, men, materials, and equipment and was directly linked to the overall “Manhattan Project.” The 509th utilized the vast bombing and gunner ranges located around Wendover Field to train for the dropping of the first atomic weapons. The facilities took on a new name, the “Technical Site.” The “Technical Site,” along with the specific men and equipment assigned by Colonel Tibbets, was given the code name, “Site W47.” This “site” was used to design, modify, and develop the aerial delivery technology and explosive components necessary for these first atomic weapons. This was done in conjunction and coordination with the atomic scientists working at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Today these facilities are abandoned, and some even removed. After the end of World War II, in order to keep secrecy with regard to the atomic program, all related atomic activities were consolidated and moved to the Los Alamos area in New Mexico. Today we know this atomic program as the Sandia National Laboratories near Albuquerque. As a result of the abrupt consolidation of atomic programs, several of the “final” assembly buildings in the “Technical Site” were removed quickly, some being removed with blow torches by cutting the metal beams of the buildings off at ground level. As a result of the fast move, the floors and foundations of the final assembly buildings were left intact, including the copper-lined floors, which were grounded in order to prevent inadvertent detonation of the weapons during build-up and modifications by the crews.\nUnlike other bomber units of World War II, the 509th Composite Group trained intensely to achieve the mission of dropping but one bomb with an extremely high degree of precision for the technology of the day. They of course succeeded, dropping two atomic weapons on Japan; Hiroshima (August 6, 1945, by the aircraft “Enola Gay”) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945: by the aircraft “Bockscar”). After the completion of the August 9, 1945, mission, Japan made an unconditional surrender, bringing to an end World War II, and ultimately saving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of American and Japanese lives, which would have certinly been lost with the planned invasion of Japan scheduled to occur later in 1945 or early 1946.\nWendover Field TodayAfter the war, Wendover Field continued to be used for training exercises, gunnery range operations, and as a research facility. The Air Force closed Wendover Field in 1969, and the base was declared surplus. In 1972, it was turned over to the State of Utah for use as a municipal airport and then finally deeded to the City of Wendover in 1977, followed by Tooele County in 1998. A portion of the original bombing range is now called the Utah Test and Training Range and is used extensively by the U.S. Air Force.\n\n(photo captions)\n• East end of Wendover Field\n• Control Tower\n• Tokio Trolley\n• Enola Gay, Smithsonian’s Steven F.

The WP, incorporated March 6, 1903, provided a standard-gauge-track connection to the Pacific Coast, operating 1,719 route miles in California, Nevada, and Utah. Operation through Wendover began in 1907, when the route was completed west from Salt Lake City across the Bonneville Salt Flats to the Nevada border at Wendover. In 1908, the Denver and Rio Grande consolidated its various branch lines and subsidiary companies in Utah and Colorado, including the Rio Grande Wester, to finance the completion of the Western Pacific line. By the end of 1909, Western Pacific Railroad began operating its newly laid rail line through the area. The final spike was driven at the center of the Spanish Creek trestle, known today as Keddie Wye in California, connecting Salt Lake City to Oakland and San Francisco. The Rio Grande lost control of the Western Pacific in 1916, and the WP remained independent until it merged with the Union Pacific in 1982.\nWendover Chosen\nWendover was chosen as the desirable location for a railroad subdivision encampment. Although no water was available, extensive studies by WP engineers and accountants determined that installation of a water line at Wendover instead of Shafter, 30 miles to the west, would save $100,000 a year in operating costs. Wendover lay at the foot of 33 miles of one percent grade track to the west and 100 miles of level track to the east. Westbound trains had helper engines added to make the trip over the mountains. The helper engines were removed before heading eastbound across the Bonneville Salt Flats. Wendover’s Western Pacific Railroad had loading docks, train station facilities, water storage, housing, maintenance facilities, yards, and terminals, with permanent yard crews to provide service before the trains continued to the Pacific Coast or east to Salt Lake City.\nArea War EffortsDuring World War I, the Western Pacific Railroad served as a connection point for the Deep Creek Railroad. This line hauled valuable processing ores from the arsenic mines of Gold Hill, some 30 miles to the south, for distribution throughout the West. In the early 1900’s, arsenic was used in the processing of fine metals such as copper, silver, and gold. During World War II, Wendover was booming, and a large contingent of workers operated the railroad in Wendover 24 hours a day. The WP brought men, women, equipment, and materials to Wendover Field, providing much-needed transportation in and out of the area as part of the overall war effort.\nFrom 1909, until merging with the Union Pacific Railroad in 1982, the WP was one of the West’s most popular railroads, including the operation of the famous passenger train, the California Zephyr. One hundred years after the first train pulled into Wendover, the route is still in use. Steam locomotives are no longer in need of water, but now large diesel-electric locomotives pull the freight coast to coast along these same rail lines of an era long past.\n(photo captions)\n• 1909 Salt Flats Gov. stop train photo\n• 1909 Utah, Nevada state line photo\n• Railroad 1906 Town Photo\n• Wendover Western Pacific railway depot\n• 1914 Salt Flats run of Teddy Tetzlaff\n• California Zephyr observation car", "photos": [{"photo_id": 467924, "filename": "467924.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 25, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Western Pacific Railroad Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 643, "aspect": 1.59253499222395}, {"photo_id": 468002, "filename": "468002.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 404, "aspect": 2.53465346534654}, {"photo_id": 468003, "filename": "468003.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 975, "height": 634, "aspect": 1.53785488958991}, {"photo_id": 468004, "filename": "468004.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 360, "aspect": 2.84444444444445}, {"photo_id": 468005, "filename": "468005.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Western Pacific Railroad Marker (wide view; Wendover Boulevard in background)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 758, "aspect": 1.3509234828496}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.07295, 40.74072]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 131827, "number": null, "title": "Washoe City", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1977, "erected_by": "E Clampus Vitus Snowshoe Thompson Chapter No.1827", "address": "75A Old Washoe City Road", "city": "Washoe City", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Carson-Reno Highway.

With the arrival of motorized vehicles, service and fueling stations began to appear, as well as many food, lodging and supply businesses. As the transportation routes have developed over time, so have the vehicles that carry people and freight. Today the transportation corridor and Winnemucca's services continue to evolve with accommodation for new electric vehicles. Please visit the unique vehicle collection downstairs at the Humboldt Museum. \nThe Humboldt River itself has also changed through time. While it played a critical role in westward expansion and as a travel corridor which helped connect America, this use took its toll.  \nStarting with \"the scorched earth policy\" in the 1820s, the impact of thousands of emigrants and livestock, and the effects of irrigation and other modern developments, the Humboldt River today bears little resemblance to the river that provided so much to Native Americans. However, there is hope for the future. A Bureau of Land Management (BLM) restoration project in Elko County has led to self-reintroduction of beavers, resulting in the creation of lush meadows and more diverse habitat and wildlife, perhaps reflective of how the Humboldt River would have looked in earlier times. \nIn 1992, Congress designated the California Trail National Historic Trail. In 200o it designated the Applegate Trail , the Nobles Route, and the surrounding terrain, as the Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trail National Conservation Area. For more information on the California Trail please visit the California Trail Interpretive Center (CTIC) located eight miles west of Elko. Also watch out for outdoor interpretive signs at rest stops along I-80. Driving guides and other information are available at the CTIC, the Humboldt Museum, the Marzen House Museum in Lovelock, the Churchill County Museum in Fallon, the BLM Black Rock Station in Gerlach (April to October) and the BLM office in Winnemucca. \nAs you look below, or travel I-80, think of the river as it was, a sparking stream teaming with life, and the people who traveled its banks though the years.

Americans embraced their new freedom to explore, leading to a demand for transcontinental auto routes. In 1921, the Federal Highway Act was passed and the Victory Highway was established between New York City and San Francisco in honor of World War I veterans. Rather than being a single road, the Victory Highway was a transcontinental route that incorporated many existing roadways. In northern Nevada, this route included sections of the California Trail and abandoned sections of the Central Pacific Railroad. It was designated US 40 in 1927. This route also became a major artery for freight. Motels, campgrounds, restaurants and service stations sprouted up along the route in places like Winnemucca to provide services for travelers. \nIn 1956, I-80 was authorized as part of the interstate highway system with the final segment opening in 1986. I-80 paralleled much of US 40 and incorporated portions of it. Although I-80 by-passed towns, affecting commerce in places such as Lovelock, Winnemucca faired better than most because it is conveniently located as fuel, food and rest stop between Reno and Elko. \nIn 1923, Congress funded a lighted airway along the transcontinental airmail route from New York to San Francisco. Lighted airway beacons provided navigational aids for nighttime flights. This reduced the time for coast-to-coast delivery of mail by two days because it was no longer necessary to transfer mail to trains for nighttime transport. Beacons were spaced 10 miles apart with closer spacing in flatter areas. Concrete arrows were used as beacon foundations - these pointed to the next beacon. Although beacons were abandoned due to changes in technology, some arrow-shaped foundations and a few standing beacons still exist.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 499070, "filename": "499070.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Victory Highway and Transcontinental Airway System Marker", "subcaption": "Captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 499075, "filename": "499075.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Victory Highway and Transcontinental Airway System Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.74438, 40.97696]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 141451, "number": null, "title": "Railroads and Telegraphs", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Humboldt Museum, Bureau of Land Management", "address": "175 Museum Avenue", "city": "Winnemucca", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Museum Avenue near Maple Avenue, on the left when traveling west.

On May 10, 1869 the CPR and the Union Pacific Railroad (UPR) were joined at Promontory, Utah. On May 11th, according to the Humboldt Register, the first transcontinental train passed through Winnemucca celebrated by \"Firing guns, blowing whistles, ringing bells, 'driving spikes', and drinking champagne.\" \nThe Transcontinental Railroad was highly important to the development of the United States as it linked the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and transformed the emigrants' difficult six-month cross-country journey to a comfortable six-day train trip. Communication was also greatly enhanced by the Overland Telegraph that was built simultaneously along the railroad route. \nLocal historian J.P. Marden states, \"The Central Pacific Railroad changed the history of Winnemucca like no other single event ever would. It brought the world to Winnemucca and Winnemucca to the world.\" In September of 1868 Winnemucca was officially designated as CPR stop. A train station and round house (where trains could be serviced and turned around) were built on Railroad Street. Winnemucca residents could board the train at the station and travel to San Francisco in a day. Native Americans received free passage on freight trains and Chiefs were granted free coach travel. \nThe railroad also facilitated the transportation of freight. From the 1860s through the 1940s, thousands of cattle were shipped from Winnemucca. According to J.P. Marden, \"In the early days it was said that a person could not eat a steak in San Francisco that had not started life on northern Nevada grass. \n\nMany of the Chinese who helped build the CPR settled along this route. Winnemucca had a thriving Chinatown located in the vicinity of the current Humboldt County Library.  \n\nIn 1899, the CPR was sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad (SPR) and in 1908 the Western Pacific Railroad (WPR) built a second transcontinental railroad and telegraph line through Winnemucca. The WPR paralleled the CPR route from Wells to Winnemucca, after which it took a more northerly route to California by way of Gerlach. Although some sections of the CPR/SPR and the WPR have been rerouted, both railroads are still in use today. The WPR (in view below where you stand) is now owned by Union Pacific and used by freight trains only, but you cans still ride Amtrack's California Zephyr along much of the original CPR route.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 499073, "filename": "499073.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Railroads and Telegraphs Marker", "subcaption": "Captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 499074, "filename": "499074.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Railroads and Telegraphs Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.74437, 40.97696]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 141452, "number": null, "title": "Explorers and Mountain Men", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Humboldt Museum, Bureau of Land Management", "address": "175 Museum Avenue", "city": "Winnemucca", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Museum Avenue near Maple Avenue, on the left when traveling west.

The popularity of felt hats was partially responsible for an increased demand for beaver pelts, but there was also political motivation. The British owned Canadian based Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) embarked on a \"scorched earth\" policy to trap all beavers in the region to make it less attractive to Americans. This policy led to the decimation of the Humboldt River beaver populations. \n\nHBC's Peter Skene Ogden reached the Humboldt River at a point near present-day Winnemucca on November 9, 1828, and returned again in 1829. Although Ogden and his party were the first documented non-natives in this area, an intriguing inscription in Humboldt County indicates that others possibly were here as early as 1807. \n\nThe first Americans to travel along the Humboldt River were members of a trapping party lead by Joseph Walker in 1833. From 1833-1834 Walker explored the entire river. In 1845 he guided a contingent of John C. Fremont's Third Exploration Expedition along the Humboldt River to its terminus in the Humboldt Sink. Fremont named the river after the famed geographer Baron von Humboldt. \n\nThe main purpose of Fremont's expedition was to explore and map the area. Fremont determined that the region was a vast area of internal drainage that he named the \"Great Basin\" His findings put to rest rumors that there was a river that ran from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific. \n\nMajor trapping efforts ended by the 1840s. Although trappers helped open the West and pioneered routes that would later be used by emigrants, they also caused long-lasting devastating effects to the river ecosystem and impacted Native Americans. Although early interactions with Ogden's exploration parties were friendly, it is clear that the Native peoples understood the damage that the trappers were causing as Ogden's party would sometimes find their beaver traps vandalized. In 1833, the Walker Party responded to trap thefts by killing several Shoshones. When a large group of Paiutes approached the Walker Party in the Humboldt Sink, wanting to greet them, the trappers misunderstood and fired on the the group tragically killing more than 30 Native Americans. \n\nSubsequent use of the Humboldt River corridor by Euro-Americans exacerbated impacts to the river and to Native Americans.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 499076, "filename": "499076.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Explorers and Mountain Men Marker", "subcaption": "Captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 499079, "filename": "499079.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Explorers and Mountain Men Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.74438, 40.97696]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 141453, "number": null, "title": "The California Trail", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Humboldt Museum, Bureau of Land Management", "address": "175 Museum Avenue", "city": "Winnemucca", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Museum Avenue near Maple Avenue, on the left when traveling west.

Reed was banished from the wagon train, but ironically he and his companion made it over the Sierra and led several rescue efforts to save surviving members of his family and others stranded at Donner Lake. \nThe Applegate Trail was established in 1846. Emigrants using this route turned of the main California Trail at present-day Rye Patch Reservoir to travel west across the Black Rock Desert on their way to Oregon and California. The Nobles Route cut off from the Applegate Trail in 1852 and was later amended in 1854. \nEmigrants started their journey from Missouri River towns in late April or early May and generally reached the Humboldt River in the blazing heat of mid-July and August. By this time, many were running low on provisions. Their animals were weary and undernourished and the grass along the river has been grazed out y the preceding emigrant traffic. Many animals perished, and their corpses littered the trail and decomposed in the river. Emigrant s were often forced to abandon their wagons, discard many of their belongings and fashion packs to carry the barest of necessities on their own backs or on their animals. Emigrants complained about the Humboldt River in their diaries, as the river they encountered was a far cry from the productive river Native Americans knew prior to the arrival of Euro-Americans. \nTo the east of present-day Winnemucca, emigrants found vast fields of grass known as \"The Island\" and camped in a spot known as \"Upper Meadows.\" As early as 1852, whiskey, ginger beer and beef were traded there. By 1863, there was a small settlement near the confluence of the Humboldt and Little Humboldt Rivers called Frenchman's Ford. Emigrants forded the Humboldt River in several places in this area to get better grass. \nIn the 1860s, the California Trail and associated routes and cutoffs were used to transport freight to regional mines. The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 ended most cross-country use of the California Trail, but portions of the trail continued to be used as wagon roads.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 499077, "filename": "499077.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The California Trail Marker", "subcaption": "Captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 499081, "filename": "499081.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The California Trail Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.74437, 40.97696]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 141454, "number": null, "title": "The Humboldt River", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Humboldt Museum, Bureau of Land Management", "address": "175 Museum Avenue", "city": "Winnemucca", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Museum Avenue near Maple Avenue, on the left when traveling west.

It has been a conduit for travel, trade and communication from prehistoric times to the present. From its headwaters near Wells, Nevada, the river slowly meanders 300 miles across the northern Nevada desert to its terminus in the Humboldt Sink near Lovelock, Nevada. \nFor thousands of years before the first Euro-Americans traveled the river, it was a thoroughfare and source of life for native peoples and wildlife. The river provided water, food, and shelter in this arid environment. \nBecause of its vital importance to life, Northern Paiute and Western Shoshone people consider all water, including the Humboldt River, sacred. Of particular importance to the health of the river were beavers. Beavers built dams that created ponds, wetlands and fertile meadows that were magnets for wildlife. The ponds acted as filters, purifying the water, and also provided stable water sources during periods of drought. \nLarge salmon-sized Lahontan Cutthroat Trout, an important food source source for Native Americans, thrived in these ponds. \nNative Americans had a network of trade routes that enabled them to trade goods with other native peoples. Trade routes also served as travel routes to hunting and gathering areas. A major Native American trade route followed the Humboldt River, other routes extended to the north and south. Local Native Americans traded obsidian (volcanic glass) for items such as shells from the California and Baja California coasts. Obsidian was used to make tools while shells were used for necklaces and decoration of baskets and clothing.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 499085, "filename": "499085.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Humboldt River Marker", "subcaption": "Captions", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 499087, "filename": "499087.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "August 26, 2019", "submitted": "October 22, 2019, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "The Humboldt River Marker", "subcaption": "This marker is on the far left.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.74437, 40.97696]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 141504, "number": null, "title": "Veterans of Foreign Wars Historical Building", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2017, "erected_by": "Chief Truckee Chapter No 3691, E Clampus Vitus", "address": "255 VFW Historic Lane", "city": "Reno", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on VFW Historic Lane near Baker Lane, on the right when traveling west.

It was a relay system between 190 stations along the route. A fresh horse was used every 12-15 miles and a new rider was used every 75-100 miles. It took 75 horses to go one-way. Approximately 1900 miles took 10-12 days in the summer and 12-16 in winter. The service had an almost perfect track record. Only once the mail didn't make it because horse and rider were killed. The Pony Express was short-lived due to the completion of the transcontinental telegraph in 1861, which could send news in just a few minutes.\nThe EquipmentTwo Navy Colt revolvers & rifle • Bowie knife • Horn to sound arrivals • Bible for courage • Mochila pouch to carry mail • Some riders carried less so they weren't overloaded. \nThe HorsesBetween 400—500 horses were picked for their great spirit and endurance. These tough horses could carry riders with little worry about food or water. They galloped over rocks, desert sands and snow. They bravely outran Indian attacks. Breeds like Morgans and Thoroughbreds often were used on the eastern end of the route; Pintos in the middle; and Mustangs in the west. \nThe RidersRiders had to swear they would drink \"no intoxicating liquor\". Booze bottles found along the trail show this oath was not always honored on the isolated route.\nThe stationmasters and attendants also had a lonely and dangerous job. Not only did the riders have to watch out for Indian attacks and brave horrible conditions, stationmasters also were in constant danger and many lost their lives.\nFamed rider Robert \"Pony Bob\" Haslam rode 380 miles round-trip in 36 hours. It was billed as the longest and fastest run in Pony Express history. \nAt age 15, William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody made the longest non-stop ride when his relief rider was killed.

The Pony Express ended in November 1861, but this Station was used as a stopover for freight wagons until the late 1800s. It laid covered in sand for many years until it was unburied in 1976. The living conditions here were filthy. The station had no roof and no chairs. The sand would blow into the structure day and night. The well nearby contained water loaded with sulphur and was barely drinkable. It makes you wonder why anyone would work here. Maybe it was the hope of adventure. \nPony Express stations were placed every 10 miles or so to change-out horses and riders. A stationmaster took care of the horses and listened for riders who would sound their horns when arriving. The men working in these stations fought loneliness, unbearable weather conditions and Indian invasions. Many were killed. \nWhat was it Like?A plume of alkali dust races toward you across the barren, sun-baked flat. Quickly, the pounding of hoofbeats grows more powerful beneath your feet. The wind carries the blare from a horn across the sand and the fresh, half-breed Mustang that you hold begins to prance, eager to go. A rider, crouched over a lathered horse, suddenly sprints around a low dune, trumpets his arrival once more, and reins in beside the station's corral. Before you can grab his horse's bridle he has already jerked the mail pouch from his saddle and dismounted. Within moments he throws it onto the fresh horse, lifts himself into the saddle and is gone, dashing east toward Sand Pass.\nThe Station TodayThere are interpretive signs in each room of the station and a one-half-mile self-guided interpretive loop trail that winds past the station.\nPlease do not take, move or climb on any of the remnants. The structure is fragile and it should remain here, untouched, to show and tell all visitors about this amazing American story!\nAmazing accountsIn March of 1860 Bolivar Roberts, J.G. Kelley and a few others built Sand Springs Pony Express Station. James McNaughton was stationmaster at Sand Springs for a while before he became a rider. \n\"One day I trotted into Sand Springs covered with dust and perspiration. Before I reached the station, I saw a number of men (Indians) running toward me, all carrying rifles, and one of them with a wave of his hand said, ‘All right, you pooty good boy, you go.' I did not need a second order, and as quickly as possible rode out of their presence, looking back, however, as long as they were in sight, and keeping my rifle handy.\" —J.G. Kelly, Pony Express Rider \nOn October 17, 1860, English explorer Sir Richard Burton gave this account of the Sand Springs Station:\n\"...The water near this vile hole was thick and stale with sulphury salts; it blistered the hands. The station house was no unfit object on such a scene, roofless and chairless, filthy and squalid, with a smoky fire in one corner, impure floor, the walls open to every wind, and the interior full of dust. Of the employees, all loitered and sauntered about desoeuvre's as cretins except one, who lay on the ground crippled and apparently dying by the fall of a horse upon his breast bone.\" —Sir Richard Burton, Explorer\n”Sand Springs deserved its name… the land is cumbered here and there with drifted ridges of the finest sand, sometimes 200 feet high and shifting before every gale”. —Sir Richard Burton, Explorer", "photos": [{"photo_id": 502421, "filename": "502421.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "July 29, 2014", "submitted": "November 13, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "What Are Those Rocks Out There?

The Newe or\nWestern Bands of the Western Shoshone\nNation called this area home. The Newe\nhad seasonal campsites throughout\nnorthern Nevada. During the spring,\nthey dispersed from the winter villages\nto gather plants and hunt. During late\nsummer, they gathered again to hunt\nbigger animals and fish and stockpile\nfood for the long winter months. The\nwinter villages would be located in the\npinion/juniper forests because fuel for\nfires was readily available. In the 1870's\nself governing reservations and colonies\nwere established with traditional schools.\nThe Te-moak Tribe was established in\n1918. The Western Shoshone Nation\nretains the traditions, pride, and culture\nand diligently passes it on to the next\ngenerations. \n\nTravel along the Humboldt corridor\nbegan with the fur trappers in the late\n1820s followed by the gold rush in 1849.\nUpwards of 250,000 people traveled the\nCalifornia Trial between 1841 and 1869.\n\nElko was established on December 28,\n1869 as the Central Pacific Railroad was\nbuilding eastbound during construction\nof the transcontinental railroad. The\nname of Elko was chosen by CPRR vice\npresident, Charles Crocker. He saw\nantlered animals in the area and chose\nELK with O for emphasis. The Union\nPacific and Central Pacific Railroads\njoined together north of the Great Salt\nLake, May 10, 1869. \n\nChinese immigrants were the laborers\nduring the construction of the Central\nPacific Railroad. After the railroad was\ncompleted, many Chinese returned to\nElko, as it was quickly becoming a mining\nand ranching center. Two joss houses\n(Chinese temples) and homes were built\nin the area of Fifth and Silver Streets.\nThese ambitious men worked the mine\ntailings, owned stores, ran restaurants,\nand worked as cooks on the area ranches.\nIn Elko, some pooled their money and\nbought a large tract of land. They dug a\n10-mile water ditch from the Humboldt\nRiver, near Osino, to Elko and built a\nreservoir where the Bicentennial Flag\nis today. Vegetables were grown at the\n“China Ranch” which were sold through\nthe county. (This area is now the location\nof the Elko County Fairgrounds and Elko\nCity Park. \n\nCarly mining was based in Tuscarora,\nnorth of Elko, in the early 1870s as\npart of mining's boom and bust cycles.\nIn the early 1960s, the Carlin Trend was\ndiscovered with rich microscopic gold\nore.

With\ntwo railroads and multiple crossings in the\nmiddle of town, traffic was often clogged and\nnumerous train/auto accidents took place.\nIn 1979, “Project Lifesaver” realigned the\nHumboldt River, moved the two railroad\ntracks out of downtown Elko a few blocks\nsouth and relocated the rail yards east of\nElko. This change forever improved the\nsafety and environment of downtown. \n\nThe idea for the project came from Mark\nChilton, who had extensive experience as a\nrailroad engineer with the Western Pacific\nRailroad and knew the engineering staff\nand management with the Southern Pacific\nRailroad. \n\n“Project Lifesaver” eliminated at least\n16 railroad crossings through Elko by\nrelocating 5.4 miles of tracks from between\nCommercial and Railroad Streets to just\nnorth of the Humboldt River, outside the\ndowntown corridor. The project stopped all\ntrain-vehicle and train-pedestrian incidents:\nsaving many lives. After five years of\nplanning, construction began in 1979 and\nwas completed in 1984.. \n\nBefore the tracks were relocated, it was\nnot unheard of to wait an hour or more for\none of the fifty daily trains to pass through\ntown.

The letters spelling \"Hard Rock Café\" consist of 1,538 10-watt clear incandescent light bulbs, Approximately 4,110 feet - more than three quarters of a mile - of neon tubing glows on the sign with more than 700 individual neon units. Neon colors used in the sign are Ruby Red, Clear Red, 3500K White and Yellow Gold II. The sign majestically stands more than 80-feet tall with a 24-foot girth.\n\nThe Restoration Campaign\nYESCO donated the guitar sign to the Neon Museum in 2017.

The campaign quickly gained global attention with generous individuals and businesses contributing from 13 countries around the world including Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, donors contributed from 42 States and U.S. territories including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nThe switch was flipped to officially light the restored Las Vegas Hard Rock Café guitar sign on March 4, 2019 during a celebration honoring the donors whose generosity made this restoration possible.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 510289, "filename": "510289.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "January 31, 2020", "submitted": "February 16, 2020, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "The Las Vegas Hard Rock Café Guitar Sign Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "aspect": 1.77777777777778}, {"photo_id": 510291, "filename": "510291.jpeg", "photographer": "Douglass Halvorsen", "taken": "January 31, 2020", "submitted": "February 16, 2020, by Douglass Halvorsen of Klamath Falls, Oregon.", "caption": "The Las Vegas Hard Rock Café Guitar Sign Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 576, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.5625}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.135, 36.17688]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 145956, "number": null, "title": "Lost City Museum", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1935, "erected_by": null, "address": "721 S Moapa Valley Boulevard", "city": "Overton", "subcity": "Overton", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from South Moapa Valley Boulevard.

The passage of time, growth, and history of the state are signified by the emerging branches of the sagebrush which depict progress, civilization, art. The sagebrush, prevalent in Nevada, is a constant reminder of how nature gives us relaxation, contemplation, beauty, and a much needed link between the cosmos and humanity. Home to Nevada's basin and range topography, sagebrush has played an integral role in the development of the state. As civilization rises in conjunction with nature, history begins. A sense of place is established. Home for many follows. A state is born. \nArtist StatementSagebrush is one of the most prominent features in the Nevada landscape and also serves as the state flower. The dominance of this shrub in our environment was the inspiration for this sesquicentennial sagebrush sculpture. Twisted and tortured by the elements, the sagebrush is a symbol of the ruggedness of our state. The fifteen bent fence posts harvested from my family ranch form the structure of this piece and represent the fifteen decades since Nevada's admission to the union. They also remind us of our impact on the land. Although common, the brush takes many shapes and forms, creating a beautiful tapestry of texture and color throughout the Great Basin. Its importance as a habitat must be recognized, protected, and shared, so that is why I have incorporated a sage grouse and a bluebird into this artwork. There is nothing like the scent of sagebrush after a lovely desert rain, something Nevadans take for granted, yet miss when it is gone.Susan Glaser ChurchOctober 2014 \nHistory of NevadaIn 1864, the American Civil War had been raging for several years. President Lincoln was up for re-election and many feared he would not win because of the devastation of America's most deadly war. There was a push to change Nevada's status from a territory to a state, to better his chances for victory. Nevada's rich silver mining would be helpful for financing the North's efforts in the continuing war. Nevada was made the 36th state on October 31, 1864, and the new citizens voted several days later in the general election, held in early November, helping to re-elect President Lincoln and bring a swift conclusion to the war. It is believed the addition of one more state, favoring the North, was the final blow to the South, and Nevada helped win the war just a few months later. Since Nevada became a state during the Civil War, \"Battle Born\" has always been a state motto and slogan. \nSesquicentennial Time CapsuleIn October of 2014 the State of Nevada concluded a yearlong sesquicentennial celebration, which in Elko County included parades, parties and many community activities. The Sesquicentennial Sagebrush and Time Capsule, that you see here, helped to commemorate the celebration. Buried beneath the northeast corner of the Sesquicentennial Sagebrush, is a time capsule filled with artifacts and photographs documenting Elko County life and people in 2014, and the celebration of 150 years of Nevada Statehood. The intention of the Elko Arts and Cultural Advisory Board, who facilitated the time capsule and commissioned the building of the Sagebrush, was that the time capsule should be opened in 2064, during celebrations of Nevada's Bicentennial. The citizens of Elko in that year are encouraged to open the time capsule at an appropriate time and share the contents with the entire community. If it is desired, they are also encouraged to again fill the time capsule for generations beyond 2064 from which to learn and enjoy. \n (Nevada Timeline)\n1864 • Nevada becomes the 36th State in the Union, \"Battle Born\" during the Civil War \n1867 • First Gold discovered in Elko County \n1869 • Elko County Est. \n1917 • Incorporation of City of Elko \n1920 • 1st Elko County Fair\n1926 • First Airmail in Elko\n1927 • City of Wells Incorporated\n1937 • Wildhorse Reservoir Constructed\n1941 • Beginning of “Big Name” Casino Entertainment in Elko\n1964 • Gold Discovered at Carlin Trend \n1967 • Great Basin College (Formerly NNCC) Est. \n1971 • City of Carlin Incorporated \n1975 • Spring Creek Est. \n1983 • Last Train through Elko “Project Lifesaver”\n1988 • South Fork Dam Built\n1991 • Wendover Incorporated\n1993 • Elko named “Best Small Town”\n2014 • Sesquicentennial Sagebrush & Time Capsule Dedicated Ending a Year of Statewide Celebrations \n2064 • Open the Time Capsule Beneath this Sculpture\nBackground Photo Credit: Susan Summer Elliot", "photos": [{"photo_id": 513698, "filename": "513698.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 18, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Sesquicentennial Sagebrush Sculpture & Time Capsule Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 453, "aspect": 2.26048565121413}, {"photo_id": 513700, "filename": "513700.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 18, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Sesquicentennial Sagebrush Sculpture & Time Capsule Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 513699, "filename": "513699.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 18, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Sesquicentennial Sagebrush Sculpture", "subcaption": "(located near marker)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.7518, 40.84312]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 146800, "number": null, "title": "Ruby Valley Pony Express Station", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2016, "erected_by": "Lucinda Jane Saunders Chapter #1881, E Clampus Vitus", "address": "1515 Idaho Street", "city": "Elko", "subcity": null, "county": "Elko County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Idaho Street, 0.2 miles north of 14th Street, on the left when traveling north.

What was taken each year by these gatherers and hunters was replaced by nature, thus maintaining a natural balance.\nFrom nearly 250,000 emigrants, their oxen, mules, horses and cattle followed the road along the Humboldt, in the process upsetting the centuries-old natural balance. Emigrants took advantage of the variety of plants and wildlife, depleting much of the river's natural resources and leaving little or nothing for the native tribes.\nThe constant processions of emigrant wagons compacted the soil along the Humboldt's bank, creating a well-defined road. This roadbed evolved into part of the right-of-way of the Central Pacific Railroad in 1869, linking the eastern and western United States. The route has served as northern Nevada's primary transportation corridor up to the present day. \nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, I-80 was built through Nevada following the Humboldt River and paralleling the original emigrant trail.\nWater BarrelsFilled at places along the trail where water was plentiful, they slaked the thirst of both people and animals on long waterless stretches of the trail.\nWashtub & WashboardThe labor-intensive predecessor of the modern clothes washer, these were used on the trail to wash clothing and the emigrants themselves.\nStewpotAn essential item for use in preparing meals along the trail, and would also be needed by emigrants after they arrived in California.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 513695, "filename": "513695.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 18, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "From Covered Wagon to Freeway Travel Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 500, "aspect": 2.048}, {"photo_id": 513697, "filename": "513697.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "March 18, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Covered Wagon to Freeway Travel Marker detail", "subcaption": "\"I also saw a very singular hot spring.

From here, you can be in California in a few hours. For the emigrants, it was as much as a month's journey. As you drive and look at the country, think about those people who plodded along day after day through the thick alkali dust and sand — headed toward dreams of gold or a new life.\nThe California Trail had its beginnings at several points along the Missouri River, and included several variant routes across the Great Basin and over the Sierra Nevada mountains into California.

In the 1880 Census Manuscript of Carson City, of the 789 Chinese, 706 were men and of these, 267 were married, 18 were widowed, 391 were single, and 30 gave no information. Among the 83 women here, 21 were married, 58 were single, and 4 gave no information. There were seven complete families. Also listed were three Chinese school teachers, suggesting that there were more than the 19 reported children, age 15 and under. These teachers were important in the effort of preserving Chinese language education. The wealthy merchants in town probably provided them with a salary. The official census count was much smaller than the real number because census takers often missed Chinese women and others who were not in the city at the time, but working as miners, lumbermen, woodchoppers, laborers, ranchers, and cowboys, and other occupations in nearby regions. The 789 Chinese held 60 different jobs including: bootblack, dishwasher, gardener, packer, porter, rag picker, servant, waiter, cook, farmer, fisherman, freighter, herder, huckster, locksmith, mule packer, peddler, sailor, scissors grinder, trainer, baker, barber, blacksmith, butcher, carpenter, clerk, chair maker, cooper, dyer, fan maker, hairdresser, hostelry, jewelry, lumberman, merchant, miller, painter, restaurant owner or worker, shoemaker, tailor, teamster, watchmaker and repairer, weaver, wood dealer, laborer, bookkeeper, chemist, dealer, dentist, physician, pharmacist, gambler, joss house operator, opium den owner, student, teacher, housewife, housekeeper, ironer, laundry owner, laundryman. The variety of occupations indicated a relatively self-sufficient community with some members who interacted with the larger community. \nCarson City's Chinatown was a communication and transportation center for neighboring Chinatowns, such as the one in Virginia City. Its over seven large merchandising firms handled imported silk garments, lumber, foodstuffs, medical care, and herbal medicines between the 1850s through the 1890s. Due to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and subsequent immigration acts, the Chinese American population declined drastically and Carson City's Chinatown gradually disappeared by the 1950s. New immigration acts in 1965 and later saw a new growth of Chinese American residents in Carson City.—Sue Fawn Chung, Department of History, University of Nevada, Las Vegas\nChinatown Plaque developed by Eileen Cohen and Bernie Allen of the Carson City Preservation Coalition in Cooperation with Dr. Sue Fawn Chung, UNLV, Jeff Kintop & Guy Rocha, Nevada State Library & Archives, Eric Moody, Nevada State Historical Society, & Bob Nylen, Nevada State Museum.

Covering terrain thought to be too extreme for mechanical power, eleven mules would be required to pull a single loaded car up the hill. After great deliberation, a Baldwin Steam Locomotive was purchased and upon arrival, was affectionately named, \"The Mule's Relief\". The first working trip was accomplished on June 22, 1881 by hauling a car load of lumber up to the mines. On August 19, 1882, tragedy struck when the little engine lost control and failed to negotiate curves, overturning and killing the engineer beneath the wreckage. It took 16 mules to pull the engine up to the mill shops and one month to rebuild it. Operations continued until the eventual closing of the mines in 1889, but the Austin City Railway was able to hang on until 1893.\nDedicated June 7, 2014 (6019)", "photos": [{"photo_id": 540644, "filename": "540644.jpeg", "photographer": "Frank Gunshow Sanchez", "taken": "September 27, 2020", "submitted": "September 28, 2020, by Frank Gunshow Sanchez of Hollister, California.", "caption": "Austin City Railway Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 775, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7568359375}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-117.07132, 39.49325]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 157591, "number": null, "title": "Virginia and Truckee Roundhouse", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": null, "address": "813 North Carson Street", "city": "Carson City", "subcity": null, "county": "Carson City", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on North Carson Street, on the right when traveling north.

We\ninvite you to explore and try to imagine what\nthis once thriving town was like in 1907.  \n\n Rhyolite at a Glance - 1907   \n \nNamed for the prevailing rock in the area.  \nEstimated population: 5,000 - 8,000 people.  \nBoom years: 1905-1911.  \n• 18 grocery stores  \n• 50 saloons  \n• 19 lodging houses  \n• 6 barbers  \n• 4 bakeries  \n• 35 gaming tables  \n• 8 doctors  \n• 3 railroads", "photos": [{"photo_id": 547666, "filename": "547666.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "October 27, 2020", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Rhyolite Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 787, "aspect": 1.30114358322745}, {"photo_id": 547669, "filename": "547669.jpeg", "photographer": "Central Nevada Historical Society", "taken": null, "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Marker Detail", "subcaption": "The City of Dreams, Rhyolite 1908.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 726, "aspect": 1.41046831955923}, {"photo_id": 547667, "filename": "547667.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "October 27, 2020", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Rhyolite Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 547668, "filename": "547668.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "October 27, 2020", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Bottle House", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 547670, "filename": "547670.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "October 27, 2020", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 769, "aspect": 1.33159947984395}, {"photo_id": 547671, "filename": "547671.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "October 27, 2020", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 547818, "filename": "547818.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": "Circa 1908", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 836, "height": 602, "aspect": 1.38870431893688}, {"photo_id": 547822, "filename": "547822.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "October 27, 2020", "submitted": "November 4, 2020, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Train Depot", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-116.82958, 36.89765]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 159358, "number": "CON-27", "title": "Central Overland Trail - Cold Springs Station", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2014, "erected_by": "Trails West, Inc.", "address": null, "city": "Fallon", "subcity": null, "county": "Churchill County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on U.S. 50, on the right when traveling west.

Eventually served by three water systems and three railroads, the\nTonopah and Tidewater, the Bullfrog Goldfield, and the Las Vegas & Tonopah - whose 1908 depot still stands - Rhyolite boomed. By 1907 it claimed a\npopulation of 6,000. With the economic collapse of 1907, and the closure of\nCharles Schwab's Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1910, the town died. By 1920\nonly 14 residents remained. During its heyday, the lack of local timber supplies\nled to concrete and adobe being used for most buildings, though three buildings\nwere built from empty bottles with one still standing today.

They cultivated small gardens and fields, planted fruit and shade trees, and tried to convert the local Southern Paiutes. \n\nMost of the Mormons departed in 1857, and in 1865, Octavius Decatur Gass began developing the Las Vegas Rancho, using the adobe structures as headquarters. He farmed and raised beef cattle, supplying travellers [sic] and miners in the Potosi region.\n\nHelen J. Steward, owner of the property from 1882 to 1902, expanded the ranch to 1,800 acres, which she sold to the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad for the Las Vegas townsite.

Believed to be sinking, and thus in danger of blocking the channel, higher authorities ordered the ship beached, an order reluctantly carried out. Located at the north end of Battleship Row, just astern of the USS ARIZONA, the crew immediately responded to the order for all ships to sortie. Already severely damaged by a torpedo hit and a serious fire from a bomb hit in her forecastle, the crew got up steam, cast off the lines and worked the ship out of a very constrained position bracketed by the flaming wreck of the ARIZONA ahead, and a dredging line just astern. Once underway the NEVADA became the prime target for Japanese aircraft. She suffered numerous bomb hits and near misses, and much strafing. Numerous fires were burning in the ship.Despite this damage and with very heavy casualties on the anti-aircraft battery complement, all guns were still firing, the places of the wounded and dying taken by men from other divisions of the ship. Many of these fell early to be replaced by others. All guns remained manned and were still firing when the last enemy aircraft left. Pearl Harbor was a defeat only in a statistical sense. There is no record indicating that a single American failed to stand and do his duty. Nevada Point symbolizes all of these gallant men, representing them as a tribute to a particularly gallant crew who, when duty called, responded with unquestioned courage. The USS NEVADA, the oldest battleship to survive the attack, lived to fight on through World War II. More importantly, the spirit of the men who breath life and vitality into their ship will forever remain an inspirational legacy for all succeeding generations of Americans.

Nicknamed the \"Slim Princess,\" it provided transportation from Mound House, Nevada to Keeler, California through western Nevada. A trip on the C&C across desolate, desert territory was hot, dusty, and slow. Rarely on time, the train covered 300 miles a day delivering supplies, mining equipment, and food products, including fresh milk, to small towns. The train also provided water for Paiute Indians who filled vessels at selected sites along the track.\"It was called ‘the road that began nowhere, went nowhere, ran 300 miles through the desert to get there, and was built 100 years too soon,’\" wrote Fannie Hazlett, Dayton pioneer historian.When mining drastically declined circa 1900, operating the C&C was no longer profitable. The Southern Pacific bought the line from D.O. Mills and provided a mail route between Mound House and Fort Churchill. One day a week the mail train carried passengers. The narrow-gauge track was converted to broad-gauge in 1905 to connect Goldfield and Tonopah.The Dayton Station closed its doors in 1934. The station, originally located on Railroad Street near the Carson River, was moved to its current site at Main Street and U.S. Highway 50 E. after Chester Barton purchased it in 1954 to remodel it as a private residence.Plans for the station, owned today by the Historical Society of Dayton Valley, include rehabilitating the structure to its original appearance. The renovated building will house a visitor's center and a railroad museum.Before the C&C served Dayton, Wells Fargo stagecoaches and thousands of emigrants traveling by wagon train crossed Main and Pike streets during the mid-to-late-1800s mining boom that began with the California Gold Rush. Pony Express riders also galloped along this route during the short time the Pony Express operated (1860-1861).Nevada's first Chinatown once flourished at the corner of U.S. Highway 50 E. and the bridge, with 200 Chinese living in stone, mud, and tule houses along the Carson River. In 1859, U.S. Army explorer James H. Simpson noted in his journal: \"Chinatown has two stores, one recently kept by E. Sam who was drowned the other day attempting to ford the Carson River on horseback...\"In 1861, Chinatown was officially named Dayton — after John Day, the man who surveyed the town site.[sidebar] Dayton's HistoryWelcome to Dayton's Historic Sector.In 1849, a pack train of Mormons traveling to California's goldfields camped near what is today the town of Dayton while waiting for the Sierra snow to melt. Their guide, Abner Blackburn, discovered Nevada's first gold at the mouth of the canyon. News spread to California. By 1851, hundreds of gold-seekers had swarmed into Gold Canon, where a tent city grew and ultimately became the town that was formally named Dayton in 1861.Blackburn's gold find led to the discovery of the Comstock Lode in Virginia City in 1859, then to the creation of the Nevada Territory in 1861, and finally to statehood for Nevada in 1864. Take a trip back in time: Close your eyes. Imagine it is 1853. Dayton's Pike and Main Streets are dusty overland emigrant trails teeming with pioneers, some on horseback, others on foot or riding atop oxen-drawn covered wagons; many of them had traveled nearly 2,000 miles on their trek toward California.Dayton's rousing history is revealed through photographs and narrative on five historical kiosks located around town and in the Dayton Museum. (See their locations below.)Dayton’s Historical Highlights:• Home to Native Americans for thousands of years prior to Euro-American emigration.• Site of Nevada's first documented gold discovery in 1849 at the mouth of Gold Cañon, where Dayton began.• Site of Nevada's first cemetery, established in the 1850s in what was then lower Carson Valley, Utah Territory.• Nevada's earliest permanent Euro-American settlement, inhabited since at least 1851.• Site of first Chinese settlement in Nevada, 1857.• Site of Pony Express stop called Nevada, 1860-1861.

Initially called Ponderer's Rest, the town was named Chinatown after 150 Chinese workers arrived in 1857 to dig a water ditch from the Carson River to mining operations in Gold Cañon. The ditch project was the first significant construction project in the state. Dayton became a milling center, processing ore from Virginia City's rich silver and gold mines at mills on the Carson River.In 1861, Dayton was named for town surveyor John Day and became the county seat of Lyon County in the newly created Nevada Territory. A year later, in 1862, the town was ranked the third-largest community in the territory. By 1865, Dayton had seven hotels, five saloons, three grocery stores, one brewery, three lumberyards, a military unit, farming and ranching operations that produced well for the region, and a schoolhouse. Mining waned, and by 1880 Dayton's population had dropped to 200.Today, the Dayton area is one of the fastest-growing communities in the nation.[sidebar] Dayton's HistoryWelcome to Dayton's Historic Sector.In 1849, a pack train of Mormons traveling to California's goldfields camped near what is today the town of Dayton while waiting for the Sierra snow to melt. Their guide, Abner Blackburn, discovered Nevada's first gold at the mouth of the canyon. News spread to California. By 1851, hundreds of gold-seekers had swarmed into Gold Canon, where a tent city grew and ultimately became the town that was formally named Dayton in 1861.Blackburn's gold find led to the discovery of the Comstock Lode in Virginia City in 1859, then to the creation of the Nevada Territory in 1861, and finally to statehood for Nevada in 1864.

By 1851, there were 200 miners panning for gold at the mouth of the canyon.Blackburn's gold strike led to the discovery of the Comstock Lode in Gold Hill and Virginia City in 1859. Dayton prospered because of the Carson River — lifeblood of the ore mills.An estimated 30 ore-processing mills operated along the Carson River in and near Chinatown (Dayton) beginning in 1859. Many mills were massive, elaborately engineered structures. They were powered by river water and firewood cut from the mountains surrounding Dayton Valley.The first water-powered mills on the Comstock were constructed in 1859. The Logan & Holmes Mill was built near what is now Dayton State Park, and the Hastings & Woodworth Mill was sited west of Old Town Dayton.The Rock Point Mill, erected circa 1860 west of the Carson River, withstood the test of time. Although it changed ownership and was often renamed, this mill site outlasted the other Dayton mills.In 1898, Captain Herman Davis revived the Rock Point Mill (though the mining boom had ended), renaming it the Nevada Reduction Works Mill. By 1906, Davis was operating the milling business as a closed corporation. He owned 93 percent of the stock. The company employed 55 men, paying high wages of $3 to $8 a day. When the mill burned in 1909, Davis didn’t rebuild.In 1912, the Hotaling Estate Company rebuilt the mill. An aerial tramway carried ore from the Hayward Mine in Silver City to the mill for processing. The tramway was dismantled two years later.

The story of Eilley and Sandy Bowers is a historic boom and bust tale. The mansion itself remains a powerful symbol of Nevada's history — an era where fortunes skyrocketed overnight, and disappeared just as quickly.TODAY, Bowers Mansion has been preserved for all of us to enjoy.Eilley BowersOne Woman's Incredible JourneyEILLEY BOWERS was the visionary force behind this mansion. Independent and fiercely resourceful, her life is a captivating tale.ALISON \"EILLEY\" ORAM was a young woman when she married Stephen Hunter and emigrated from Scotland to Salt Lake City as part of a Mormon migration. By the time the Hunters reached the Utah territory, the strain on their marriage was evident and they soon divorced.IN SALT LAKE CITY Eilley married another Mormon, Alexander Cowen, and together they traveled to Washoe Valley on a church mission. That too ended in divorce. Eilley remained in the area and opened her own boardinghouse for miners in Gold Canyon, near Virginia City. She soon began buying and selling mining claims — an endeavor few other women attempted at the time. That proved to be one of the most significant decisions of her life.Strikin' It Rich!Mining Boom, Days of GloryAS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, a hardworking miner named Lemuel Sanford \"Sandy\" Bowers held a land claim right next to Eilley's at the Little Gold Hills mine. The two met, became business partners, married in 1859, and set up the Bowers Mining Company.FOR MANY IT WAS JUST A DREAM, but the Bowers actually did strike it rich. Their mine began producing $18,000 a week in gold and silver. That's almost half a million dollars by today's currency value! From her humble beginnings in Scotland, Eilley became the \"Queen of the Comstock.\"Spare No Expense!The Makings of a MansionEAGER TO SPEND THEIR SUDDEN FORTUNE, the Bowers decided to build a luxurious mansion here, on the land Eilley had acquired from Alexander Cowen in their divorce settlement. Boomtowns like Ophir, Franktown and Washoe City were springing up nearby, making it a strategic location.THE MANSION WAS BUILT in the Georgian and Italianate architectural styles. These styles reminded Eilley of the elegant homes in her native Scotland. She hired local stonecutters to help in the construction of her dream estate. She chose every manner of opulent accessories for the house.AS THE WALLS AND FLOORS WERE RISING to the bustle of hammers and saws, Sandy and Eilley went to Europe for ten lavish months to shop for their new house. They returned with the most elegant of European furnishings, and also a baby girl named Margaret Persia.Troubled TimesClimb High, Fall HardTHROUGHOUT ALL OF EILLEY BOWER'S LIFE, triumph mixed with personal tragedy. For a time, it seemed as if the Bowers had everything — wealth, a magnificent home, and a daughter. Yet, the family's life soon took a turn toward troubled times.THE MINE RAN DRY BY 1867. In 1868, Sandy died of silicosis (a miners' lung disease), just a few short years after their great dream home had been completed. In 1874, Eilley's beloved daughter Persia died suddenly at the age of 12. Eilley was left alone with a broken heart, the burden of a mine gone bust, and the formidable task of maintaining the mansion and property.Picnics and PartiesBowers Mansion as a Social SceneFACED WITH MOUNTING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, Eilley decided to open the mansion as a social attraction in an effort to make ends meet. It was promoted as a premier resort and entertainment destination. She hosted grand picnics and parties all summer long. This began a tradition of using the property for public fun and relaxation that exists to this day.FINALLY, in 1876 after many efforts to save the mansion, Eilley lost everything. The mansion was put into foreclosure. Mrs. Eilley Bowers spent the rest of her days drifting between Virginia City, Reno and the Bay Area telling fortunes with a crystal ball. She died penniless in Oakland, California in 1903.A Lasting LegacyTHE TRADITION THAT EILLEY BOWERS BEGAN of using this property for fun and relaxation continues today. Her vision has become the park's legacy. Visitors like you may still relax and enjoy this park, and marvel at this beautiful mansion built in such a dynamic era.Photos courtesy:Nevada Historical SocietyUniversity of Nevada Special CollectionBowers Mansion County Park", "photos": [{"photo_id": 560159, "filename": "560159.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 21, 2016", "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Bowers Mansion Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 465, "aspect": 2.20215053763441}, {"photo_id": 560166, "filename": "560166.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "By the time she was in her thirties, Eilley Bowers had been married three times, lost two infant children, and traveled thousands of miles from her homeland.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 617, "aspect": 1.65964343598055}, {"photo_id": 560202, "filename": "560202.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "These figures [on the balcony] may have been Sandy and Persia Bowers.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 620, "aspect": 1.65161290322581}, {"photo_id": 560169, "filename": "560169.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "Velvet curtains  Five woven rugs  Wood-carved chairs  Gorgeous wallpaper  One “cranberry swirl” chandelier  Gilded mirrors  Art galore", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 915, "aspect": 1.11912568306011}, {"photo_id": 560224, "filename": "560224.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 500, "aspect": 2.048}, {"photo_id": 560229, "filename": "560229.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "Aside from being a businesswoman, Eilley had another more curious talent", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 876, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.85546875}, {"photo_id": 560230, "filename": "560230.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "One of Eilleys attempts to save herself from financial ruin was a massive remodel that added a third floor.

In spite of the area's famous mining heyday, agriculture and ranching have been the real mainstays of life for local residents since the mid-nineteenth century.OWNING THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT for the job was essential and expensive. Just like today, people valued the best in innovation and were always keen to purchase tools offering convenience and improved productivity.What Are These Contraptions?Horse RakeIN THE LATE 1800s American farmers began using horse-drawn rakes to gather their hay. The machines originally had large wooden teeth that would cut the hay, but these often broke on rocky terrain. Later models had steel spring teeth. Once the hay was dry, men and boys used pitchforks to collect the hay and toss it into wagons for transport.The Osborne Harvester/BinderBY 1880 MANY COMPANIES were manufacturing harvesters that cut standing grain and automatically tied it into neat bundles. This type of machine revolutionized the grain industry. Now one man could do the work of many and save weeks of precious time.The Deering Hay MowerTHE FIRST HORSE-DRAWN MOWING MACHINE was patented in 1812, but improvements on its design continued for the next forty years. The big issue of concern was how to protect drivers from falling and being injured by the cutting bar. The Deering hay mower you see here was a later and safer design, with the cutting bar in front of the driver. It was used in Washoe Valley in the late 1800s.Can You Spot this Equipment?Fresno ScraperTHIS MACHINE IS ALSO CALLED a “buck scraper” and it was used in the early days of horse-drawn road grading. The Fresno Scraper you see here is believed to have been used in the late 1870s. It helped to create a road connecting Old Washoe City to Franktown.Early Irrigation PipeBEFORE METAL AND PLASTIC PIPES were available, water was moved through ditches and wooden pipes like the one you see here to irrigate crops and bring water to livestock and people. The main advantage of using pipes was that it helped reduce water loss due to evaporation and seepage.A Farming HeritageSOME EARLY FARMERS were prosperous. They fared much better than the miners, and the hay they harvested was valued on the Comstock at $100 or more per ton.IF A FAMILY LEFT THE AREA, it was common practice to leave anything behind that couldn't be easily transported. All the items you see here were donated by local residents.These relics are valuable symbols of local heritage and agricultural traditions in Washoe Valley.Art by Faith Rumm", "photos": [{"photo_id": 560742, "filename": "560742.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 21, 2016", "submitted": "December 31, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Rusty Relics Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 299, "aspect": 3.4247491638796}, {"photo_id": 560757, "filename": "560757.jpeg", "photographer": "Faith Rumm", "taken": null, "submitted": "December 31, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 505, "aspect": 2.02772277227723}, {"photo_id": 560760, "filename": "560760.jpeg", "photographer": "Faith Rumm", "taken": null, "submitted": "December 31, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 526, "aspect": 1.9467680608365}, {"photo_id": 560766, "filename": "560766.jpeg", "photographer": "Faith Rumm", "taken": null, "submitted": "December 31, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 630, "aspect": 1.62539682539683}, {"photo_id": 560242, "filename": "560242.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 21, 2016", "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Rusty Relics Marker", "subcaption": "(horse rake in background)", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 732, "aspect": 1.39890710382514}, {"photo_id": 560763, "filename": "560763.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 21, 2016", "submitted": "December 31, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Wooden Irrigation Pipe", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 731, "aspect": 1.40082079343365}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.84167, 39.28454]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 163625, "number": null, "title": "Horses to Horsepower", "subtitle": "Time to Gas Up!", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Washoe County Department of Regional Parks and Open Space", "address": "4005 Bowers Mansion Road", "city": "New Washoe City", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Bowers Mansion Road (Alternate U.S. 395) 5.8 miles north of Eastlake Boulevard, on the left when traveling north.

Myron C. Lake first acquired the mansion and worked hard to revive its glory. The picnics and social affairs continued, but to limited success. One idea he had was to convert the mansion into an insane asylum. Before that happened however, Theodore Winters acquired the property, in the hopes of transforming the mansion into the \"new Monte Carlo.\" He never achieved that dream, but he did revive the picnic season and visitors briefly returned to Bowers Mansion.EVENTUALLY, Winters gave the mansion to a friend as a gift, but by 1894 that gift had fallen into sad disrepair. All but abandoned, the house was soon in a terrible state of decay. Jackrabbits and birds moved in; the doors were nailed shut; the fishpond was filled with weeds; dry fountains crumbled in the mansion's front yard, and giant ivy leaves spread all over the exterior of the house. Homeless vagabonds were the only people who used the bathhouses anymore.The Riter FamilyTo the RescueIN 1902, A MAN NAMED HENRY RITER was drinking a pint of beer when he spotted a painting of the Bowers Mansion hanging in a Reno saloon. He found the mansion to be so impressive that he bought the painting and the house site-unseen! He paid $1,000 for the mansion and its 46 acres of surrounding land. Little did he know of the mansion's state of disrepair.A MAN BORN TO MODEST MEANS, Mr. Riter worked hard as a businessman, eventually acquiring a small fortune. He was in a good position to splurge on revitalizing the mansion to its original glory. Riter and his wife set to work restoring the property to turn it into a glamorous resort and picnic destination. For the next two years, the mansion underwent intensive repairs, preparing the historic house for its next big debut as a top-notch attraction.The Party Goes OnReviving Eilley's VisionONCE THE MANSION WAS RESTORED, the Riters oversaw a long summer of entertaining and parties in 1905. The season ended with a special moonlight picnic for all local residents. Beneath the Nevada sky, under a bright full moon, guests swam in the pools, danced till dawn, and enjoyed delicious food.OVER THE YEARS, Mr. Riter leased the mansion to several different people. While he always remained the mansion's owner, and always kept Eilley’s vision for the property alive, he did not live full-time in the house until 1915. At one point, a doctor ran the mansion. He used the medicinal qualities of the hot springs to cure patients. Later on, new leaseholders remodeled the house into a hotel. They boasted that the mansion provided first class meals and rooms, a fine dancing platform, and the best swimming pools in the state.MR. RITER CARED FOR THE MANSION until his 80th birthday. Then, in 1943, he decided it was time to sell the family estate.Reno Women's Civic ClubThe Women Who Saved Bowers MansionHENRY RITER'S ONLY WISH FOR HIS BELOVED BOWERS MANSION was that it be sold as a park, so that future generations could enjoy the estate just as their parents had. He and his wife waited eagerly to see if the state would purchase their home and make it into a state park.LITTLE GOOD NEWS CAME THEIR WAY. It wasn't until a chilly winter morning that the fate of Bowers Mansion was revealed: a group of local women would buy the property! They were cash poor, but passionate to save the historic house. Mr. Riter accepted their down payment of only $1.00 with the understanding that they could get the rest of the money in three months time.THE RENO WOMEN'S CIVIC CLUB switched into high gear. They began a statewide drive to raise funds: they advertised in newspapers, and they hung giant street signs reading: \"Help Buy Bowers Mansion!\"A Park is BornWashoe County ParksBY LATE MAY, 1943, the Reno Women's Civic Club had gathered $25,000 in contributions, but unfortunately they needed $75,000 more to acquire the estate. Hearts were heavy until they received some exciting and unexpected news: Washoe County would pay the rest! County commissioners had come to realize how important Bowers Mansion was to the public, thanks to the women's publicizing efforts. The historic site would be saved.THE BOWERS MANSION RESTORATION COMMITTEE was soon formed and volunteers got busy improving the old building's structure and refurbishing the rooms with Victorian era pieces. The Reno Women's Civic Club remained deeply involved in all future restoration activities. The mansion was reopened to the public in 1950.FOR THE PAST HALF-CENTURY, ongoing repairs and maintenance of Bowers Mansion have been under the supervision of Washoe County Parks. We are proud to protect and manage this valuable landmark of local heritage.Enriching Our FutureProtecting the LegacyBOWERS MANSION SYMBOLIZES not only an important dimension in Nevada state history, but also the energy, commitment, and strength of those that fought to preserve it. Historic resources like this are irreplaceable. Together, we can ensure that they will last for generations to come.Photos courtesy:Nevada Historical SocietyUniversity of Nevada Special CollectionBowers Mansion", "photos": [{"photo_id": 560236, "filename": "560236.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 21, 2016", "submitted": "December 29, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "History in the Making Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 473, "aspect": 2.16490486257928}, {"photo_id": 560480, "filename": "560480.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 30, 2020, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Marker detail", "subcaption": "During the summer of 1878 the V&T (Virginia and Truckee) train offered special Sunday excursions to Bowers Mansion.

When the first non-native explorers entered the area, it was the home of the Northern Paiute people, known as the Cattail-eaters or Toidikadi. Like the prehistoric inhabitants who lived there before them, the Toidikadi used the abundant marsh resources to supply most of their material needs.Houses were built of cattail and tule bundles. Tule stems were bound together, tied with cattail leaves and formed into boats. With these, off-shore marsh resources such as duck eggs and fish could be gathered. Clothing was made from the shredded and twined fibers of sagebrush bark. Baskets, duck decoys, cradleboards, nets and even sandals were fashioned from the marsh plants. It has been said, quite accurately, that the Cattail-eater people tied their world together.Plants and Animals Change with the ClimateTen thousand years ago the climate was moist and much milder. River otters played on the banks of slow moving, placid streams. Huge ground sloths fed on the streamside vegetation. Beavers and bald eagles were common. As the climate changed, the plants and animals found in the area also changed. Today most of them are desert species, adapted to surviving hot temperatures and long periods without water.Desert animals often find water in plants or the flesh of their prey. They tend to be swift-footed, running and leaping creatures adapted to the open country. These desert dwellers are active mainly at night, choosing to spend the hot, burning days in burrows where the temperatures may be as much as 80 degrees cooler than on the surface. Desert plants have waxy leaf surfaces or tiny leaves so that less moisture is lost to the atmosphere.Grimes Point Interpretive TrailPlease feel free to walk the one-half mile loop, self-guided interpretive trail. This trail winds through a large boulder field. Many of the rocks have petroglyph carvings, some possibly dating as far back as 7,000 years. Hundreds of petroglyphs of different types can be found within this boulder field.Hidden Cave Interpretive TrailLocated a little over a mile northeast of Grimes Point, visitors will find another self-guided interpretive loop trail. In addition to petroglyphs, you will see rock shelters, learn more about native plants and animals, geology, and the daily lives of the prehistoric people. Because of the fragile nature of Hidden Cave itself, the cave is open only-for guided tours. Please contact the Bureau of Land Management or the Churchill County Museum for information about tours of the cave.[side 2]Welcome toGrimes Point Archaeological AreaA Focal Point of Prehistoric UseHumans first visited this area over 8,000 years ago. Lakes and marshes provided materials for making baskets and netting. Antelope and desert bighorn sheep grazed on the hillsides surrounding ancient Lake Lahontan. Sandhill cranes and ducks nested along the shoreline. Caves and rock shelters provided cover. Hidden Cave was used as a storage place for food, tools, and other important essentials. Today, all that remains of that greener, wetter and biologically rich era are remnants, fossils and artifacts.Ancient Artists — What Were They Saying?Nobody knows for sure. Some of the rock art boulders within this site may have been carved as long as 8,000 years ago — others less than 500 years ago. Some are abstract images with stripes, dots and zig-zags. Some are human figures, goats, snakes and horn toads. The meaning of the rock art is still debated by scholars. What stories do you see etched on the rock?Help Preserve This Special PlaceGrimes Point Archaeological Area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

The company was moved to the site around 1912 by W.C Pitt, a prominent land and business owner. In 1904 a newspaper article announced the coming harvest of the ice saying that ice was now 6 inches thick and apparently of good quality. The ice, cut from the river and sloughs, was packed in straw and used for refrigeration on railway cars and the refrigeration of the local creamery products. A 1931 newspaper article told of the Pitt Mill grinding wheat into prize-winning flour. A fire that completely destroyed all but the ice house in 1975 was one of the worst fought by the Lovelock Volunteer Fire Department. One firefighter who was there said they eventually had to let the fire burn itself out and use their time saving the other nearby properties. The ice house was later removed due to safety concerns at the end of 2016.Dedicated this day of March 31st 2018/6023Jesse Lee Reno 1422 Outpost of Lucinda Jane Saunders #1881E Clampus Vitus", "photos": [{"photo_id": 568671, "filename": "568671.jpeg", "photographer": "Lance C Johnson", "taken": null, "submitted": "February 11, 2021, by Lance C Johnson of Sun Valley, Nevada.", "caption": "The ice house Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 600, "height": 800, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-118.47297, 40.1818]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 166731, "number": null, "title": "Beautiful Jumble", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2019, "erected_by": "Jesse Lee Reno 1422 Outpost of Lucinda Jane Saunders 1881, E Clampus Vitus", "address": null, "city": "Lovelock", "subcity": null, "county": "Pershing County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Rye Patch Resevoir Road (Route 401) west of Dwight D.

The name of the range and mining district comes from the seven water troughs built by a local sheep rancher, Frank M. Ward in 1984 to water his sheep. Large deposits of silver and gold were found in the area in 1905. In 1906 and 1907 other valuable minerals led to the formation of the Seven Troughs Mining District. Historic production from 1907-1955 was 158,468 oz. gold grading 35.6 g/t and 995,876 oz. of silver grading 223.9 g/t. Joe Therian, the local blacksmith was given credit for the first discovery of gold and silver ore within the district. Louise A. Friedman was the dominant figure in the Seven Troughs Mining District along with William Stauts, who located nine claims along the sides of the canyon. These claims would later become part of the Seven Troughs Therian Gold Mines Company. The three most northerly claims were purchased by the Mazuma Hills Extension Mining Company. Around this time O.T. Owens and Frank Crumpacker made another discovery just the south and later consolidated with Therian. The district consisted of four major town sites. Coming from Lovelock, Vernon was the first. This once active town had a post office and provided mail service to the area. The remains of the original jail house are still visable. Mazuma was the next town located at the mouth of the Seven Troughs Canyon. On July 18, 1912 the town was all but washed away and 11 people died during the flood. E.H. Bennet gave the following description, \"the torrent rushed down the canyon playing havoc with everything it touched until it reached the head of Main Street. At the bend just above Preston's Store it came upon the home of the Kehoe's. The children were in the road playing in front of the house along with Perry Gillespe, the son of Mr. Gillespie, manager of the Darby Ore Reduction Company. Mrs. Kehoe and the children were all caught by the flood, and but one remains to tell the story.\" Five miles north lies Farrel named after Jack Farrel who made a supposedly unbelievable strike near the town site. At the top of the canyon lies the town of Seven Troughs, in 1907 town lots were being sold for $250 to 500.00. There are also encampments such as Tunnel Camp, which was established during the latter part of 1926 when work effort ramped up to dig the 11,900 ft \"deep\" tunnel. Halfway House was built in 1906 and was the halfway point between Vernon and Lovelock. There are several small operations still pulling minerals and precious metals from other mine sites in the Seven Troughs Mining District today.E Clampus Vitus Jesse Lee Reno 1422 Outpost of Lucinda Jane Saunders 1881Dedicated April 6th, 2019 6024", "photos": [{"photo_id": 568609, "filename": "568609.jpeg", "photographer": "Lance C Johnson", "taken": null, "submitted": "February 10, 2021, by Lance C Johnson of Sun Valley, Nevada.", "caption": "Seven Troughs Mining District Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 600, "height": 800, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-118.48162, 40.17029]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 167144, "number": null, "title": "Pershing County Court House", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2017, "erected_by": "Jesse Lee Reno 1422 Outpost of Lucinda Jane Saunders #1881 E Clampus Vitus", "address": null, "city": "Lovelock", "subcity": null, "county": "Pershing County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Central Avenue north of Western Avenue, on the left when traveling north.

The railway\nreached Reno in June and shortly afterwards the original station was replaced by the much grander wood framed Depot Hotel. This two story building had the best rooms and restaurant in early Reno. In 1871 the Virginia and Truckee Railroad laid tracks to the Depot Hotel, and a third floor was added in 1876. The addition burned the following year and was quickly repaired. The Great Fire of 1879 completely destroyed the building. That same year a larger and even grander Depot Hotel was built with three stories, 47 rooms, a bar, and offices for both railroads. The Depot Hotel once again\nburned to the ground in 1889. The CPRR decided not to fund another Depot Hotel, instead building a small brick one story station with a slate roof.\nIn 1926 the Southern Pacific Railroad replaced the station\nwith a more traditional Depot at the east end of this block.\nAn annex was built on the west end of the Depot to provide\naccess to the lowered tracks.

It was a one room combination saloon, general store and stagecoach station located along the \"Big Bend” of the Carson River about ten miles northeast of where Fort Churchill later was constructed. The site is now submerged by the modern-day Lake Lahontan. On May 7, 1860 Williams Station was raided by the Paiutes. Accounts vary as to the exact details leading to the Williams Station \"Massacre\". Most accounts say that two young Paiute girls were abducted by the traders, held at the station and molested. About nine Paiute warriors went to the station, forcing five white men, believed to be have been responsible for the kidnapping inside the building: Oscar Williams, David Williams, Samuel Sullivan, John Fleming and \"Dutch Phil\". The station was burned with all five men inside. Station operator and owner, J.O. Williams was camping a couple miles further up the river and thus escaped the fate of his brothers. He rushed to Virginia City to spread the news. Within no time, a militia was formed with the intent of apprehending the perpetrators. This force consisted of about 105 men and was under the overall command of Major William Ormsby. After the war the station was rebuilt and called \"Honey Lake Smith's\" and visited by Mark Twain in 1861. He did not speak highly of the place, saying \"it was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in the midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson winds its melancholy way.\" Dedicated on Cctober 24, 2020\nCopper Queen 1915\nOutpost of Julia C.

He advocated a drainage tunnel, visualizing development of Comstock ore with this access. By 1865, his vision gained approval of state and federal legislation. However, the mining interests, having at first supported the tunnel, became strongly opposed.\n\nWhen construction began in 1869, it was first financed by the mine workers since the tunnel would presumably improve mine safety. Later, the funding came from international bankers. Miners completed the main tunnel in 1878 and then extended lateral excavations, providing drainage, ventilation and access to many Comstock mines. The work on the tunnel from its lower end created a town of 600-800 and boasted of a church, post office and its own weekly newspaper, plus Sutro’s Victorian mansion and other fine residences. Adolph Sutro soon sold his interest in the tunnel company and returned to San Francisco, where he served as mayor.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 505398, "filename": "505398.jpeg", "photographer": "Paulette Nelson", "taken": "December 12, 2019", "submitted": "December 16, 2019, by Paulette Nelson of N Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "Sutro Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 812, "aspect": 1.26108374384237}, {"photo_id": 505400, "filename": "505400.jpeg", "photographer": "Paulette Nelson", "taken": "December 12, 2019", "submitted": "December 16, 2019, by Paulette Nelson of N Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "Sutro Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 636, "aspect": 1.61006289308176}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.56457, 39.27437]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 179558, "number": null, "title": "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills", "subtitle": "121st Psalm", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada Fish and Game Commissioners Personnel and Sportsmen", "address": null, "city": "Denio Junction", "subcity": null, "county": "Washoe County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Cedarville Road, 25 miles west of Denio-Adel Oregon Road (State Route 140), on the right when traveling west.

Every skilled story teller is a weaver of little lies that form a tale that is worth retelling. Great writers like Dan De Quille understood this and developed a humorous, but often not factual, style of writing that was authentic to Nevada.\nIn 1873, Fred H. Hart, an excellent practitioner of the Western journalistic tradition of the humorous literary hoax, was employed as editor of the \"Reese River Reveille,\" published in Austin, Nevada. Hart described Austin as, \"a quiet place, in which anything of a startling nature in the line of news seldom transpires.\" This left Hart with a lack of material to fill the paper.\nHart soon found a bounty of \"stories\" at The Sazerac, a local watering hole located on Main Street. The local miners, ranchers, and stage drivers would gather to tell of their adventures with standard exaggerations. Hart began recording these tales and The Sazerac Lying Club was born, with its members wearing little hatchets on their lapels and seeking the title of \"Monumental Liar of America.\"\nIn 1878, Hart published The Sazerac Lying Club. The book recorded the fictional articles reporting on the organization's fabricated proceeding. It became an instant classic and inspired three printings in its first year.\nDedicated September 26, 2020 (6025)\nLucinda Jane Saunders Chapter #1881\nJesse Lee Reno Outpost #1422\nSnowshoe Thompson Chapter #1827\nSamuel L.

The company's stock sold well until a group of investors came to Lander County to look at the budding enterprise.

Fuller, built a dwelling on the south side of the Truckee River where the third Riverside Hotel now stands. He constructed a seventeen mile crude sketch of road in the region and received permission to collect tolls. The following year he built a wooden bridge across the river along this route. The winter of 1862 had considerable flooding and this bridge, along with all the others along the Truckee, was swept away.\nThe following year, Myron C. Lake purchased the property from Fuller and replaced the bridge. Four years later, it too was damaged by high water, and was rebuilt by Lake. The importance of the site, known temporarily as Lake's Crossing, grew rapidly with the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode. With the coming of the railroad none years later, the crossing was renamed by Charles Crocker, \"Reno\" after Civil War hero, Major General Jesse Lee Reno.\nThe famous \"Iron Bridge\" was to follow in 1877. The span was moved from Virginia Street to Rock Street in 1905 when it was replaced with a more attractive concrete structure. This new crossing's low design was partially responsible for heavy flooding of downtown Reno in 1950, 1955 and 1997. Lasting over a century, this venerable bridge was demolished in 2015 to make way for a fifth known river crossing at this location.\nDedicated June 24, 6021 (2016)\nJulia C.

Horses, donkeys and mules provided the power.\n\nHow many can you find?\nAs you walk around the Tonopah Historic Mining Park, how many different ways can you find to bring the gold and silver to the surface? Above, an ore bucket is attached to a hoist which was pulled by men or animals to bring up the ore.

Gone are the days of animals, small ore carts and buckets.

Fremont’s camp was in the approximate location of the Nine Mile Ranch today.\nWith the discovery of gold in Aurora in 1860, this area was destined to become a main route from Carson City to the booming mining camps of the Esmerelda Mining District, of which Aurora and later Bodie were featured destinations. Along this route stage stops were established for the convenience of travelers.\nOver the years, the Nine Mile has been known as Cobb’s Rancho, Nine Mile House, Nine Mile Station, Green’s Station, etc., but Nine Mile Ranch is what shows on most modern maps.\nNotable people in history are known to have visited the area, including John C.

Shortly after Brown sold his business, the great fire of 1875 swept through town and destroyed the building.\nThere were rarely more than one hundred African Americans living in Virginia City during its height in the 1860s, but they played varied and important roles in the community. Some African Americans pursued work as laborers, porters, and barbers. Others became affluent business owners, and a prominent doctor won widespread respect. By the 1870's, African American children attended integrated schools. However, the decline of mining by 1880 sent many Nevadans, including African Americans, elsewhere. When mining in the state revived in the early 1900's, a shift at the federal, state, and local levels that implemented segregation via law or practice kept most African American families from returning to communities like Virginia City.\nThe site of the Boston Saloon is located uphill and to the left of this location at the corner of Union and D Streets now occupied by the Bucket of Blood Saloon parking lot.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 644360, "filename": "644360.jpeg", "photographer": "Ken Lund via Flicker (cropped) (CC BY-SA 2.0)", "taken": "March 27, 2021", "submitted": "March 22, 2022, by Duane and Tracy Marsteller of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "caption": "African Americans and the Boston Saloon Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 304, "height": 247, "aspect": 1.23076923076923}, {"photo_id": 640213, "filename": "640213.jpeg", "photographer": "Ken Lund via Flicker (CC BY-SA 2.0)", "taken": "March 27, 2021", "submitted": "February 21, 2022, by Duane and Tracy Marsteller of Murfreesboro, Tennessee.", "caption": "African Americans and the Boston Saloon Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.64838, 39.31062]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 192607, "number": null, "title": "Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Four Crash Site", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "U.S. Navy, E Clampus Vitus", "address": null, "city": "Fallon", "subcity": null, "county": "Churchill County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Old Carson Highway north of Nevada Route 50, on the left when traveling north.

The bank's first location was in a rented building on Main Street. After buying this lot on Golden Street, construction of the Cook Bank Building began in the spring of 1907. \nOne of four banks in Rhyolite, the Cook Bank Building was by far the finest. Built of poured concrete, the building was three stories tall and had a basement that housed the Post Office. The interior was finished with marble staircases and mahogany accents. It also boasted modern conveniences such as electric lights and indoor plumbing.  \n\nDespite its opulence, the Cook Bank was open less than two years. In the summer and fall of 1907, a financial crisis, often referred to as the Knickerboxer Crisis, caused banks across the country to go bankrupt. By 1910, the Cook Bank was closed, and John Cook had sold off all the building's fixtures.  \nSince the closure of the Cook Bank, the building has appeared in many movies, including: The Air Mail, The Arrogant, Cherry 2000, The Island, Delusion, Ramona!, The Reward, Wanderer of the Wasteland, Six-String Samurai, Rough Riders' Round-up, Bone Dry, Ultraviolet, and more.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 648331, "filename": "648331.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "March 31, 2022", "submitted": "April 12, 2022, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 734, "aspect": 1.39509536784741}, {"photo_id": 648332, "filename": "648332.jpeg", "photographer": "courtesy Nevada Historical Society", "taken": "Circa 1908", "submitted": "April 12, 2022, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 836, "height": 602, "aspect": 1.38870431893688}, {"photo_id": 648333, "filename": "648333.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "March 31, 2022", "submitted": "April 12, 2022, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 648334, "filename": "648334.jpeg", "photographer": "Craig Baker", "taken": "March 31, 2022", "submitted": "April 12, 2022, by Craig Baker of Sylmar, California.", "caption": "Cook Bank Building", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-116.82926, 36.90119]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 195442, "number": null, "title": "Rhyolite Train Depot", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2022, "erected_by": "Bureau of Land Management", "address": null, "city": "Rhyolite", "subcity": null, "county": "Nye County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Rhyolite Road, 1.8 miles north of Nevada Route 374, on the left when traveling north.

The first train from the Las Vegas & Tonopah entered Rhyolite at 7 p.m. on December 14, 1906, with about 100 passengers. \nIt was a big deal for a young mining town to be serviced by one railroad, but three railroads were almost unheard of in the history of Nevada. With three railroads, it seemed that Rhyolite was destined to be the largest mining camp in the state and the first few boom years made this prediction look inevitable. \n\nBy 1907, the Las Vegas & Tonopah alone was hauling 50 freight cars into town per day. The large volume of freight required a large depot to handle it.\nIn September 1907, the Las Vegas & Tonopah began building the depot that stands before you. It is constructed of concrete block with a solid concrete foundation in the Mission Revival style. There was a gentlemen's waiting area on the east end and a ladies' waiting room on the west end. A separate baggage room was located east of the men's waiting area. The ticket office was located in the center of the building, and the ticket agent's quarters were located upstairs. \nIt was planned to take an entire city block on Golden Street and cost approximately $130,000 - the equivalent of $3,798,393 in 2021. \n\nThe Las Vegas & Tonopah Railroad Depot was completed in June 1908, around the same time that Rhyolite began its slow decline. Within months of its completion, more people were leaving Rhyolite through the depot than were arriving.\nThe railroad turned a small profit in 1908 but lost money every following year until it was finally dismantled in 1919. The tracks were salvaged, but the depot was left to stand as one of the few remaining buildings from the Rhyolite boom, primarily because it could not be moved elsewhere. \n\nIn the 1920s, Rhyolite enjoyed a small revival through tourism. Wes Moreland bought the depot in 1935 and, beginning in 1937, operated it as the Rhyolite Ghost Casino. The drinking and gaming were conducted downstairs, while a different type of hospitality, reportedly staffed by \"working women,\" was conducted upstairs in the old ticket agent's quarters.\nLike the town before it, the casino had a relatively short life. The onset of World War II, and the associated war effort, including fuel rationing, completely drained the area's economy. \nBy the 1960s, the building had passed to Moreland's sister, Mrs. Herschel Heisler, who operated the lower floor as a museum and gift shop for tourists. \n\nSince the 1930s, the depot has passed from person to person, eventually ending up with the Barrick Mining Company. \nIn October 2000, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) acquired the depot, along with most of the Rhyolite Townsite, from the mining company in a land swap. \nAt some time before the swap, a group of local citizens replaced the historic depot roof with modern composite shingles. Although not historically accurate, the shingles have helped preserve the building in the relatively good condition that you see today. \nAt the time the depot was built, the local newspaper claimed it was \"the finest in the state.\" Today, it is one of the best-preserved examples of early twentieth-century Mission Revival train depots in Nevada. \n\nThe BLM's Tonopah Field Office is working to restore this historic building. If you would like to donate to the restoration, a secure donation box is located to your right. All donations will be used in Rhyolite. \nPlease help us keep the depot in its current condition.

It was directed by John Huston and written by playwright Arthur Miller. In 1956, Miller resided outside of Reno and was insprired by Nevada's vast desert landscapes, wild mustangs and local residents. The Misfits stars Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Eli Wallach, Montgomery Clift, and Thema Ritter. Miller wrote the screenplay specifically for Monroe, his wife at the time.\n\nThe Misfits' plot centers on Monroe's character, a recently divorced Roslyn Taybor and her new forlorn friends who go to the Dayton rodeo and come up with a plan to wrangle a herd of wild \"misfit\" mustangs. The film's highlight, where the actors wrangle the wild mustangs was shot on a dry lake bed near Stagecoach, 16 miles east of Dayton, now referred to as \"Misfits Flats\".\n\nThe film's bar and rodeo scenes were filmed in downtown Dayton. Marilyn Monroe's famous paddle ball scene, in which she is accompanied by the rest of cast, was shot here inside the Odean Hall and Saloon. Other local filming locations included the Washoe County Court House, the Truckee River, Harrah's Hotel and Casino, Quail Canyon, and Pyramid Lake.

Expressing innocence the next morning when called into Principal Maude Frazier’s office, the painter looked down and saw paint splatters on his shoes. Luckily, Principal Maude Frazier liked the idea and decided the Art Guild should carry-on the project in subsequent years.\n\nEnsuing senior classes created their own squares. Over the years, seniors had so much pride in their squares that underclassmen who dared walk on them had to clean the squares with a toothbrush. In 1980, the squares were removed. This caused a huge uproar with LNHS alumni, and after a “protest square” was painted, the squares were re-created in “Pebble Tech”, which was also used for new squares until 1988. By 2000, the squares deteriorated and many were barely recognizable.\n\nSpear-headed by the Class of 1970, the “Senior Squares Committee,” all Las Vegas High School alumni, was formed in 2000 to recreate the squares as close as possible to their original colors and design. Because there were originally no squares for the classes during the WWII years (1942-1945), special squares were designed to honor the graduates of those years.\n\nThe restoration project and on-going maintenance was funded by a grant from the State of Nevada and by many individual donations of funds, time, labor and materials.\nThe “Senior Squares” are an important part of Las Vegas history. It is hoped that the restored “Senior Squares” will be maintained for all ages to come.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 670518, "filename": "670518.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "August 3, 2022", "submitted": "August 8, 2022, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "History of the \"Senior Squares\" Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 515, "height": 334, "aspect": 1.54191616766467}, {"photo_id": 670519, "filename": "670519.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "August 3, 2022", "submitted": "August 8, 2022, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "History of the \"Senior Squares\" Marker and Recreated Squares", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 480, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 670520, "filename": "670520.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "August 3, 2022", "submitted": "August 8, 2022, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "History of the \"Senior Squares\" Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 480, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 670534, "filename": "670534.jpeg", "photographer": "Denise Boose", "taken": "August 3, 2022", "submitted": "August 8, 2022, by Denise Boose of Tehachapi, California.", "caption": "Bench donated by Ken Gragson LVHS Class of 1954 (to the left of the Senior Squares)", "subcaption": "Thanks to the following for making the restoration of Senior Squares possible", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 640, "height": 480, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-115.13996, 36.16547]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 203385, "number": null, "title": "St. Joan Of Arc", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 1987, "erected_by": "The International Order of the Alhambra.", "address": "315 South Casino Center Boulevard", "city": "Las Vegas", "subcity": "Downtown Las Vegas", "county": "Clark County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of South Casino Center Boulevard and East Bridger Avenue, on the right when traveling north on South Casino Center Boulevard.

City fathers quickly decided to erect a suitable building to serve as the Lincoln County Courthouse. In 1872, T. Dimmock and Thomas Keefe designed the building, and a budget of $26,400. was appropraited for its erection. Unfortunately the construction contract was broken, and because of separate contracts the eventual cost of the building was $75,000. paid by issuing bonds. Over the next 30 years new bonds were issued to pay off the previous ones. By the 1880s the county unsuccessfully tried to reupdate the bonds.

In 1910, one of the worst rainstorms in southern Nevada history hit Lincoln and Clark Counties, causing damage from Meadow Valley Wash to the Vegas valley. In 1905, the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad was built through the Meadow Valley Wash to Caliente, where it turned basically northeast to follow Clover Creek. While the route was the best in the area, planning for floods turned out to be insufficient. In 1906, 1907, and 1909, flooding washed out the tracks, causing the railroad to be stopped until repairs were made. In each case, the route was repaired, but nature was not finished with it. In the first week of January 1910, massive flooding again washed out nearly 100 miles of tracks, taking an entire engine and cars with it. Two weeks later, more flooding took out the temporary repairs which had been made. The flooding extended into the Vegas valley, cutting off all travel out of the valley for a few days. More flooding in 1911 cause the railroad to rethink its location. The rails were moved significantly higher along the Meadow Valley Wash and through the Clover Creek area. This changed allowed the railroad to survive later massive floods, most notably in 1938, and remains the route use by the railroad today.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 682064, "filename": "682064.jpeg", "photographer": "Melissa H Spease", "taken": "October 4, 2022", "submitted": "October 6, 2022, by Melissa H Spease of Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "The 1910 Flood Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 682065, "filename": "682065.jpeg", "photographer": "Melissa H Spease", "taken": "October 4, 2022", "submitted": "October 6, 2022, by Melissa H Spease of Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "The 1910 Flood Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 682066, "filename": "682066.jpeg", "photographer": "Melissa H Spease", "taken": "October 4, 2022", "submitted": "October 6, 2022, by Melissa H Spease of Las Vegas, Nevada.", "caption": "The 1910 Flood Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 768, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.75}, {"photo_id": 683502, "filename": "683502.jpeg", "photographer": "Lee Philips (courtesy of the UNLV University Libraries)", "taken": "1907", "submitted": "October 14, 2022.", "caption": "Photograph of Caliente (Nev.), 1907", "subcaption": "\"Desert of Caliente, Nevada looking west before the flood of 1910 cut a channel through the town.\" - University of Nevada, Las Vegas Libraries", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 696, "aspect": 1.47126436781609}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-114.52173, 37.61]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 207501, "number": "144", "title": "Fort McDermitt", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "State Historic Preservation Office", "address": null, "city": "McDermitt", "subcity": null, "county": "Humboldt County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is at the intersection of U.S. 95 and S Road, on the right when traveling north on U.S. 95.

Hill discovered alunite in the area in 1908. A mining district was formed, but only small amounts of gold were found. Mines in the area included the Alunite, Bean Pot, Lucky Dutchman, Ouo Vadis, Spearhead, and Vincent. The short-lived mining boom ended by 1910.\n\nWith the advent of the Great Depression, tent cities sprang up in the pass with names like Texas Acres and Oklahoma City.

An early graduate of Nevada State university, she was a teacher, suffragist, business woman, and respected community leader. Lillie’s family home was the Pink House, located on Genoa Lane. In 1919, when the citizens of Genoa wanted streetlights, Lillian suggested a dance and midnight supper, featuring homemade candy as an incentive for a good turnout. Lillian enlisted the help of the ladies of Genoa to make candy, which was the highlight of the event. The success of the event brought streetlights. Lillie and the ladies continued to organize what later became known “The Candy Dance” each year. Over the years, the Candy Dance was Lillie’s passion. Her obituary describes how she directed the 1937 Candy Dance event from the couch in her home at the Pink House. Even though she was dressed and ready, her terminal illness kept her from attending the final event of her life. Lillian’s spirit lives on in the volunteers who support the Town of Genoa’s many social and fundraising events.\nMarker Two:\nHonoring Genoa’s Volunteers Past, Present and Future\nGenoa has always been a community of volunteers. Led by Lillian Virgin Finnegan and her aunt, Jane Raycraft, the ladies of Genoa made candy for the first Candy Dance in 1919.

Hand drilling, which was a method used in the early mining days, was extremely labor intensive but was really the only option until about 1830. A single miner drilling was called \"single-jacking\". The miner held a steel drill (bit) in one hand and a 3-to-5-pound sledge hammer in the other. The average strike rate was 20 to 30 strikes per minute. Finished holes would only be about 3 feet deep due to the friction of the drill steel. In areas where two miners had enough room to work, one held the drill (called the shaker) and another swung a 7-to-10 pound, long-handled sledge. This was called \"double-jacking\". The average strike rate was around 20 strikes per minute. When the hand drilling method was used, the drill was twisted about 1/4 turn between strikes. Miners used steel drills of several different diameters. The larger diameter drills were used first working toward smaller diameters to finish the hole. Drilling chips were scooped out with a long-handled miner's spoon. Drilling rates would vary based on the hardness of rock. In some areas of hard rock mines, a 5'x7' heading could be advanced 6 inches per shift with two miners drilling. In quartz, five feet of hole could be drilled in one shift which would dull over thirty drill steels. \n\nSteam-powered drills were used around 1830. These drills advanced holes more quickly, but had numerous functional issues. The steam created a hot environment for the miners, and supply hoses carrying high-pressure steam often burst, scalding anyone in the area.\n\nAround 1850, after air compressors were invented, drills powered by compressed air began to appear.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 725177, "filename": "725177.jpeg", "photographer": "Brian Phelps", "taken": "May 20, 2023", "submitted": "May 21, 2023, by Brian Phelps of Carson City, Nevada.", "caption": "Solid Granite Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 771, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7529296875}, {"photo_id": 725178, "filename": "725178.jpeg", "photographer": "Brian Phelps", "taken": "May 20, 2023", "submitted": "May 21, 2023, by Brian Phelps of Carson City, Nevada.", "caption": "Solid Granite Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 771, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.7529296875}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.65068, 39.30787]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 223911, "number": "5", "title": "Votes for Women", "subtitle": "Road to the 19th Amendment", "subsubtitle": "National Votes for Women Trail", "erected_year": 2021, "erected_by": "William G.

This splice connected the first telephone line from the East Coast to the West Coast across the United States. The completion of the first trans-continental telephone line was accompanied with little fanfare. The last splice was made, flags were placed on the cross-poles, and photographs were taken.\nA Brief HistoryThe AT&T Corp. was formerly known as the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. The company that became AT&T began in 1875. Inventor Alexander Graham Bell had an arrangement with Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders to become partners and the financiers of his inventions. Bell was trying to invent a talking telegraph-telephone. He succeeded, earning patents in 1876 and 1877. In 1877, the three men formed the Bell Telephone Company.\nTop PriorityIn 1908, AT&T made the transcontinental telephone line their company’s top priority, even though the technology to operate one did not exist. Even with the use of loading coils, telephone communication across countries as large as the United States was not possible without some form of amplification. They needed a scientific breakthrough to amplify the electrical signal. The next year, AT&T raised the stakes when they announced that a transcontinental line would be available to coincide with the 1915 San Francisco World’s Fair - the exposition that would mark completion of the Panama Canal.\nCoast to Coast Construction BeginsWith the emergence of electronic amplifiers, the transcontinental telephone communication became truly possible. The amplifier was the first high-vacuum tube triode, adapted from independent inventor Lee de Forest’s audion or three-element vacuum tube. In 1912, AT&T began construction of the line, working east from Sacramento.\nBy 1913, AT&T had tested high-vacuum tubes on the long-distance network. In the fall of the same year, construction began on the line west from Denver, with upgrades to the east.\nNationally, phone wires were being strung to link the country as the telegraph and railroads had done in the 1860s. The span between Salt Lake City and Wendover was a problem. At times the working temperature was 130 degrees, and the glare made working in the daytime almost impossible. On June 17, 1914, the final pole was set and wires strung at Wendover to complete the first transcontinental phone line in the United States.\nFirst Coast to Coast Voice CommunicationThe first test of the transcontinental telephone line took place in July of 1914. The president of AT&T, Theodore Vail, spoke from one coast to another. Along the way, his voice was boosted in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Omaha, Nebraska; and Salt Lake City, Utah.\nThere was one problem: AT&T had completed the line six months before the Panama-Pacific Exposition was ready. So, the company waited until January 25, 1915, then opened the line commercially with a huge celebration and great fanfare. Four locations participated in the call. Cofounder of AT&T and telephone inventor, Alexander Graham Bell, leading a group of dignitaries, began the event by speaking from New York to his longtime assistant, Thomas A. Watson in San Francisco. Bell spoke the same words into the phone that he had first transmitted via telephone in 1877: “Mr. Watson, come here. I want you.” Thomas Watson replied, “Sorry Mr. Bell, it will take me a week now.” That reply was certainly appropriate, for Mr. Bell in New York was talking to Mr. Watson in San Francisco, where he had awaited this historic call. A short time later, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson congratulated everyone from a phone at the White House in Washington, D.C. AT&T President Theodore Vail spoke from Jekyll Island, Georgia.\nThe transcontinental telephone line, stretching between New York City and San Francisco, crossed through 13 states. Four copper wires were held up by 130,000 wood poles. On the day of the historic phone call, approximately 1,500 AT&T employees were positioned across the entire length of the line, east to west, including the line between Jekyll Island and New York City. The workers were prepared to fix or repair any problem that might impede the ceremonial phone call.\nMayor John Mitchel of New York and Mayor James Roth of San Francisco exchanged greetings. Mayor Mitchel said: “Hello, Mr. Mayor. As Mayor of New York, which stands at the gateway of the East, I greet you, as Mayor of San Francisco, which stands as the gateway of the West. It is a long way to San Francisco, but I think that by the completion of the transcontinental telephone line our respective cities are now doubly joined together, first by the Panama Canal which joins us together for the rapid passage of maritime commerce, and now by the telephone, which links us together by the power of the human voice.”\nFirst Underground CableTwenty eight years later, Wendover made telephone history a second time, when the first transcontinental all-weather buried cable was joined at the border in 1942.\n(photo captions)\n• Final Splice, June 17, 1914, Wendover\n• Nevada in 1914.

Hastings led a group of about 60 emigrant wagons on a route that diverged from the California Trail near Fort Bridger, Wyoming. After encountering almost impassable difficulties getting through the Wasatch Mountains via Weber Canyon, Hastings left word for the Donner-Reed party - following his trail - not to attempt Weber Canyon. The Donner-Reed party found his written warning and set James Reed to find Hastings and get his advice. Following Hastings' advice, the Donner-Reed party chose to reach the valley of the Great Salt Lake by way of Emigration Canyon. Unfortunately, it took 18 days of cutting and hacking trees and brush to bring the Donner-Reed wagons to the valley.\n\nFrom this point, they followed Hastings' trail across the Western Desert and the Salt Flats east of present day Wendover, crossing the route of I-80 about 50 miles east of here. Traveling for three days without water for themselves and their livestock, abandoning wagons and equipment, they finally arrived at fresh-water springs near Pilot Peak, 20 miles north of Wendover. \n\nStill following Hastings' trail, they crossed the route of I-80 at Silver Zone Pass, about 20 miles west of here. They continued on and took Hastings' long detour around the Ruby Mountains, finally rejoining the California Trail at the site of the present-day National California Emigrant Trail Interpretive Center at Elko, Nevada. \n\nAfter being delayed by following Hastings' route, the Donner-Reed party was trapped by October snows at what is now called Donner Pass and spent a horrible winter in survival mode before being rescued in the early spring of 1847.\n\n”Anguish and dismay now filled all hearts. Husbands bowed their heads, appalled at the situation of their families. Some cursed Hastings for the false statements in his open letter and for his broken pledge at Fort Bridger. They cursed him also for his misrepresentation of the distance across this cruel desert. Mothers in tearless agony clasped their children to their bosoms with the old, old cry, 'Father, Thy will not mine, be done.’ It was plain that try as we might, we could not get back to Fort Bridger. We must proceed, regardless of the fearful outlook…”Eliza Donner, 1846", "photos": [{"photo_id": 279313, "filename": "279313.jpeg", "photographer": "Chris English", "taken": "September 7, 2014", "submitted": "July 16, 2014, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "The Hastings Cutoff Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 468016, "filename": "468016.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "The Hastings Cutoff Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 465, "aspect": 2.20215053763441}, {"photo_id": 468017, "filename": "468017.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "The Hastings Cutoff Marker (view looking north; West Wendover Police complex in background)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 731, "aspect": 1.40082079343365}, {"photo_id": 279315, "filename": "279315.jpeg", "photographer": "Chris English", "taken": "September 7, 2014", "submitted": "July 16, 2014, by Chris English of Phoenix, Arizona.", "caption": "The California Trail Marker Series of West Wendover", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 468019, "filename": "468019.jpeg", "photographer": "Cosmos Mariner", "taken": "June 19, 2016", "submitted": "March 26, 2019, by Cosmos Mariner of Cape Canaveral, Florida.", "caption": "Hastings Cutoff Marker (wide view; marker is located near Victory Highway Arch & Monument)", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 578, "aspect": 1.77162629757786}, {"photo_id": 487111, "filename": "487111.jpeg", "photographer": "J.

", "missing": null, "link": "https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=227650", "description": "Panel One:\nUtah Territory\nThe area now making up the state of Nevada was acquired by the United States after the Mexican-American War. This newly acquired land was generally labeled as unorganized territory until 1850. The State of Deseret was an early Provisional State proposed for this land in 1849 by Mormon settlers in Salt Lake City. Ultimately, the administration of President Zachary Taylor was not sympathetic to the Mormon's desires of establishing this giant state.\nIn 1850, the unorganized territory was divided into the State of California, and the territories of New Mexico and Utah. By this time, President Taylor had died and the Presidency had fallen into the hands of Millard Fillmore. Fillmore was sympathetic and very friendly to the Mormon cause. The leader of the Mormon Church, Brigham Young, was appointed as the governor of Utah Territory on September 20, 1850.\nPanel Two: Territorial Status and Freedom from Utah\nNevada gained territorial status on March 2, 1861, due to the population explosion from the discovery of the Comstock lode. Two days later, Abraham Lincoln became the President of the United States. James W. Nye was selected as territorial Governor for patronage reasons and as a reward for his services. He was to ensure that Nevada Territory would remain loyal to the Union. Orion Clemens was appointed as Secretary of the Territory because of his political connections. Secretary Clemens came to Nevada by overland stage with his younger brother Samuel Clemens. Samuel Clemens went on to become the famous Mark Twain who poked fun at the world, including the territorial politicians.\nNevada officially became a state on October 31, 1864. The reasons for Nevada's statehood were political, not economic. By the time Congress approved the Enabling Act for Nevada on March 21, 1864, the Civil War was winding down. The Union had won critical battles at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, and the South was in shambles. President Lincoln sought reelection, and new states and their votes were needed to support his policies. Among these policies was the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. If Nevada was a state, it could ratify the amendment and help pass this landmark piece of legislation. Nevada is the \"Battle Born\" state because of its entrance into the union during the Civil War. The discovery of the Comstock Lode influenced its territorial status, but the leap to statehood was purely political.\nPanel Three: Pony Express\nAs California's population began to boom during the gold rush, so did the demand for a reliable mail service. This demand increased even further at the approach of the Civil War. Alexander Majors, William Waddell, and William Hepburn Russell partnered in 1855 and ran a freighting company with government contracts for delivering army supplies to the west. Russell came up with the idea of a similar contract they could possibly get for a fast mail service. If they utilized a short route with mounted riders instead of stagecoaches, they figured they could establish a mail route from Missouri to California with a delivery time of 10 days. After that, the mail could run by boat to San Francisco. At the time, this was considered an impossible feat. It took Russell, Majors, and Waddell two months to organize and put together the Pony Express in the winter of 1860. The operation assembled 120 riders, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel.\nThe mail route was approximately 1,900 miles long, with around 184 stations in between. The stations were set 12 to 25 miles apart. A single rider would ride 75 to 100 miles while changing horses at every station. It took approximately 75 horses to make a one-way trip from Missouri to California. The Pony Express only lasted 19 months. It became obsolete when the transcontinental telegraph reached the west.\nPanel Four: Pony Express\nLife at the Pony Express stations was pretty rough, especially at the remote stations. \"Setting aside the chance of death... the work is severe; the diet is sometimes reduced to wolf-mutton, or a little boiled wheat and rye, and the drink to brackish water; a pound of tea comes occasionally, but the draughty souls are always out of whisky and tobacco.\" Richard F. Burton\nThe Genoa Pony Express Station was located right across Main Street, just south of where the firehouse sits today. Unfortunately, the Genoa Station burned down in 1910. After leaving Genoa Station, riders either headed to Carson City Station to the East, or to Woodfords or Friday's Station to the West.\nThe mail was kept in specially designed mail pouches called mochilas. On each of the four corners were weather proof cantinas which were small leather boxes. Three of these boxes were padlocked, and only the station keepers at St. Joseph and Sacramento had the keys. The other was used for mail picked up along the way. \nThe cost to mail a letter delivered by the Pony Express was very expensive. It was $5.00 to send a 1/2-ounce letter (about $130.00 to today's standards). By the end of the Pony Express period, the price had dropped to $1.00 per 1/2 ounce, but even that was considered expensive (equivalent to $26 today). \nBilly Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider who rode the trail in Nevada. During the Paiute uprising of 1860, he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some rocks. He ended up killing seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.\nPanel Five:Pioneer Remedies\nThe early pioneers were unaware that germs caused many diseases. Because of this, early medicine was like a guessing game. When doctors were available, they were often no more knowledgeable than the patients themselves. This led to some very questionable remedies. \nMany settlers suffered from a disease called ague. Symptoms were similar to those of the flu and included fever, coughing, chills, and achiness. One so called \"cure\" for this disease was to kill a chicken and hold it's body against the patient's bare feet while he or she swallowed a ball of cobwebs! \nBaldness: Smear your head with fresh cow manure. \nCuts: Pack the cut with axle grease. \nCoughs: Put some cow dung in water and bring it to a boil. Gargle the water three times a day. \nCrick in the neck: Go down to the hog pen and find where the hog has rubbed his neck against the fence, then rub your neck in the same spot and the crick will be gone. \nWhat a quack! Sometimes pioneers were so desperate for a cure that they turned to a quacksalver, or quack for short. Quacks claimed to have miracle cures for all sorts of illnesses. Some of these cures contained unhealthy and even dangerous ingredients. Today we still call a doctor with questionable cures a quack.\nPanel Six: Pioneer Sayings\nGoing to see the Elephant \nOn the California Trail, the elephant was a metaphor for the exotic sights that travelers expected to see once they reached California. As the journey began, \"seeing the elephant\" was a positive allusion. As life on the trail got rough, references to the elephant became more and more negative. \nSleep Tight, Don't Let the Bedbugs Bite! \nDuring the 1800's, beds were made very differently than today. Strings were strung across a wooden frame, allowing an area for a mattress to be placed. The tighter the strings, the more comfortable the bed. Early mattresses were made of straw and feathers. Bugs ended up living in these mattresses, resulting in bug bites and sleepless nights. Although our beds today are usually bug free, the saying remains. \nMind your Ps and Qs \nInns were places where people stayed during their travels and gathered to drink beer or liquor. Mugs of beer only came in two sizes, pints and quarts. If a customer got a little rowdy, the bartender told that person to mind their Ps and Qs. This meant to remember how much they had drank. Today the phrase means to \"mind your manners.\" \nStogie \nToday, cigars are sometimes referred to as stogies. As the pioneers traveled west, Conestoga wagon drivers frequently smoked cigars. They thought that the cigar would act as a filter and keep the dust out of their throats. So many wagon drivers smoked cigars that they eventually became known as \"Conestogas,\" or stogies for short. \nBite the Bullet \nIn pioneer times, if an arm or leg was seriously wounded or badly broken, it would have to be cut off. There were no serious painkillers for the operation. The patient was given a bullet to bite on so they wouldn't scream. Today, \"bite the bullet\" means to accept an unpleasant situation with courage.\nPanel Seven: Mormon Station State Historic Park\nMormon Station offers many different events throughout the year. Please see the park's bulletin board or check out the museum for more information on upcoming events.\n Facilities\nPark\nThe park is open year round. Picnic tables and grills are provided throughout the park. Picnickers may enjoy the lush lawns and mature shade trees. \nMuseum \nThe museum tells the colorful story of the first settlement of Nevada.

In a sleepy town filled with 19th-century buildings, this modest stucco home was seen as state-of-the-art when completed in 1948. In 1956 the property was purchased by Bill and Silvia Campbell. Bill managed a ranch north of Genoa, while Silvia worked at Mormon Station for more than 20 years. Silvia dreamed that someday their property would become part of the state park, and in 2002, her dream came to fruition. \nToday, this part of the park features an early 1900s blacksmith shop, an early 1900s chicken house, and the restored Arribalsaga-Campbell House.\nThe White House Hotel\nWhere the Arribalsaga-Campbell House stands today was once the site of the White House Hotel (also known as Rice's Hotel). Throughout the late 1800s, the hotel was an integral part of social life in Genoa. The White House boasted a fine dining room and bar and hosted many dances and parties. In 1885 it even became the site of the first roller skating rink in Genoa!\nPanel Two: Booming Businesses\nTake a moment to observe the town around you- look, listen, and smell. How do you think the sights, sounds, and smells of Genoa in the 1800s were different than today? \nStanding here in the mid-to-late 1800s, you would see people arriving in stagecoaches. You would hear the clanging of iron. You would smell the persistent stench of fresh horse manure. These sights, sounds, and smells were a common part of two Genoa businesses-Gray's Blacksmith Shop and Gelatt's Livery and Feed Stable. Both businesses stood in the area in front of you. \nBlacksmith shops and livery stables provided vital transportation-related services. Blacksmiths at Gray's would shoe horses, repair wagons, and build wheels. At the livery, a person could board their horse, purchase feed, or catch a stagecoach. There was tremendous demand for these services for much of the mid-to-late 1800s. Genoa, a town of about 350 residents, was at times home to three blacksmith shops and three livery stables.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 735055, "filename": "735055.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": null, "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Campbell Property", "subcaption": "Panel One", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 676, "aspect": 1.51479289940828}, {"photo_id": 735057, "filename": "735057.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Booming Businesses", "subcaption": "Panel Two", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 775, "aspect": 1.32129032258065}, {"photo_id": 735059, "filename": "735059.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Campbell Property Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735060, "filename": "735060.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Booming Businesses Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735062, "filename": "735062.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Chicken House", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735063, "filename": "735063.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Blacksmith Shop", "subcaption": "Front View", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735065, "filename": "735065.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Blacksmith Shop", "subcaption": "Rear View", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735066, "filename": "735066.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Mormon Station", "subcaption": "Historic State Monument", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.84507, 39.00505]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 227666, "number": null, "title": "Eggs for Sale!", "subtitle": "Mormon Station State Historic Park", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Parks", "address": "2295 Main Street", "city": "Genoa", "subcity": null, "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Main Street south of Kinsey Way, on the right when traveling north.

Spooner acquired about 640 acres of land with the idea of starting up a sawmill, a shingle mill and a hotel. He named the area Spooner Station. Ten years and several business partners later, Spooner had acquired interests in flumes, a toll road, and other businesses, and controlled a total of 1,840 acres surrounding the summit that now bears his name. \nHe married in 1869, bringing his new wife Clara to live at Spooner Station. They had six children, two of whom died in infancy.\nA Slower Pace Life on the mountain was rustic. Winter snows often exceeded ten feet, and food-typically arriving as huge sacks of flour and sugar-was resupplied only periodically. Communication was by telegram, and travel by wagon. Imagine what life here would be like without telephones, e-mail, or the convenience of our cars!\nPanel Two:  Extensive Holdings\nthe making of a giant\nIn 1872, Michele Spooner sold his flume system and toll road to up-and-coming lumber barons Duane Bliss and H.M. Yerington, founders of the Carson & Tahoe Lumber & Fluming Company (CTLFC). By buying up smaller mills and fluming systems, their company grew to become the largest business supplying the Comstock. \nAt its peak, the CTLFC owned 50,000 acres of timber at Lake Tahoe, three mills at Glenbrook, two steamers, two logging railroads, various logging camps, and a narrow-gauge railroad. CTLFC also operated several logging flumes to transport lumber to their railroad depots in the Carson Valley.\nSpooner Summit was a key part of the operation, acting as a large receiving yard for not only the milled lumber that came up from the lake, but also for fuelwood that came down on feeder flumes off nearby peaks.\nPanel Three: A Melting Pot of industrious workers\nas the industry boomed, more help was needed\nAs business boomed, more help was needed. Mill crews were brought in from Maine, and loggers from Canada. The lumber industry opened opportunities for cultural groups from far and near; Blacks, Washoe Indians, immigrant Chinese, French-Canadians, and Italians-all were welcome.\nThe job descriptions were equally colorful: \n• Fallers (cut down the trees)\n• Buckers (cut the logs into shorter lengths)\n• Sawyers (cut the logs into lumber at the sawmill)\n• Teamsters (in charge of the oxen teams)\n• River Hogs (freed jammed logs along the riverbanks)\n• Grease Monkeys (greased the waterless flumes leading to the lake)\n• Donkey Punchers (managed donkey engines to haul logs)\n• Whistle Punks (worked on the narrow-gauge railroad)\n• Pond Men (rafted the logs)", "photos": [{"photo_id": 735100, "filename": "735100.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Life at the Summit", "subcaption": "Panel One", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 375, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.3662109375}, {"photo_id": 735106, "filename": "735106.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Extensive Holdings", "subcaption": "Panel Two", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 315, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.3076171875}, {"photo_id": 735109, "filename": "735109.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "A Melting Pot", "subcaption": "Panel Three", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 300, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.29296875}, {"photo_id": 735114, "filename": "735114.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Life at the Summit Marker", "subcaption": "Front Pillar", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735115, "filename": "735115.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Spooner Trailhead and Picnic Area", "subcaption": "The marker is in the background behind the left telephone pole.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.89517, 39.10363]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 227676, "number": null, "title": "Riding the Flume", "subtitle": "a daring adventure", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "US Forest Service", "address": null, "city": "Carson City", "subcity": "Spooner Summit", "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Lincoln Highway (U.S. 50 at milepost 13) west of Kings Canyon Road, on the right when traveling east.

Mining created a huge demand for both fuelwood and milled lumber, helping these small logging ventures grow into a major industry.\nViewed as an “unlimited” resource at the time, immense stands of pine and fir in the Carson Range and Tahoe Basin were cut to support the Comstock mines. Of the many sawmills springing up around the lake, one of the most notable was at Glenbrook, on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe and four miles from here. There, raw timber, floated across the lake from distant stands, was milled into lumber.\nUntil railroads were built, teams of oxen were the only way to haul Glenbrook’s mill products up to Spooner Summit and down to the Carson River, on their way to build the vast infrastructure of a booming mining economy.\nPanel Two:\nA Feat of Engineering\nMoving all these trees was a major challenge. To get milled lumber from Glenbrook up and over Spooner Summit more efficiently, investors constructed the Lake Tahoe Railroad, which climbed 8.75 miles to the summit.\nMore than 250 men were hired to build the Lake Tahoe Railroad, which required 22 canyon-spanning wooden trestles and a 475-foot long tunnel through mountain granite and massive tree roots. Imagine all the dynamite it took to clear the way!\nAlthough the rails were later removed and salvaged for their steel content, parts of the original route and remains of some trestles are still visible. In season, tours of the old railroad are offered by the non-profit Truckee Donner Railroad Society.\n”From the lake to the summit there is an elevation of 120 feet to the mile to overcome.”\n-\tVirginia City Chronicle, July 10, 1874\nPanel Three:\nInvesting in the Future\ntechnology developed quickly\nMany innovative engineering solutions were born here in the Sierra Nevada during the Comstock boom, in order to overcome the challenges of mining and transporting massive amounts of timber across such rugged terrain. Some of these advances eventually spread across the country, contributing greatly to the industrial revolution in America.\nThe V-Flume\nLoggers were already using u-shaped waterless flumes to transport logs down steep hills to the lake. But over time, as operations reached further into the forest, transporting these logs proved increasingly challenging. The invention of the V-flume, which channeled water through a V-shaped conduit, was a significant improvement. When a log became stuck, the design allowed water to back up, eventually floating and dislodging the obstruction.\nSquare-Set Timbering\nIn the underground mines of Virginia City, the best ore was often found in the softest rock-which meant tunnels into the loose, crumbly material were constantly caving in.\nIn 1860, German engineer Philip Deidesheimer, inspired by a honeycomb, devised a method of shoring up the excavations with large, interlocking square-set timbers. His innovation consumed vast amounts of lumber that still support the hollowed ground underneath Virginia City today. This method of timber bracing contributed to a safer era in underground mining.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 735324, "filename": "735324.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 7, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Green Gold", "subcaption": "Panel One", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 371, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.3623046875}, {"photo_id": 735326, "filename": "735326.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 7, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "A Feat of Engineering", "subcaption": "Panel Two", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 390, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.380859375}, {"photo_id": 735328, "filename": "735328.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 7, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Investing in the Future", "subcaption": "Panel Three", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 365, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.3564453125}, {"photo_id": 735329, "filename": "735329.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Green Gold Marker", "subcaption": "Left Pillar", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 735330, "filename": "735330.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Spooner Trailhead and Picnic Area", "subcaption": "The marker is in the background behind the left telephone pole.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.89513, 39.1036]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 228421, "number": "JC-4", "title": "Johnson Cutoff - Sand Hills", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2011, "erected_by": "Trails West, Inc.", "address": null, "city": "Carson City", "subcity": null, "county": "Carson City", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from U.S. 50, on the right when traveling west.

Historians estimate that between 1870 and 1900 two-thirds of Lake Tahoe's accessible trees were clear-cut. All that remained were trees too small and crooked, trees too difficult to get to, or less useful trees like red fir, white fir and lodgepole pine. \nA few remains of this early forest can still be found. Along this segment of the Tahoe Rim Trail, near Marlette Lake, you will find old growth red fir forest. \nYou also will find the remains of trees harvested by early loggers. Look for groups of very old stumps cut three to four feet above the ground. These relics have been preserved for more than 125 years by our arid climate. Please treat them with respect; they are an important part of our heritage. \nThe Big Bonanza!\nIn 1859, while the California gold rush was nearly over, silver was discovered in Nevada's Virginia Range. The Comstock silver strike began a new frenzy for wealth in Virginia City, Nevada. <\nBecause the tunnels and shafts of the Comstock mines were soft crumbling earth, they required a new design to prevent collapse. A simple invention called square-set timbering secured the mines. However, constructing and operating the mines demanded an enormous quantity of high quality timber and cordwood. \nFrom the Mountains to the Mines\nThe demand for timber was insatiable. Logging companies responded by constructing an impressive network of railways, barges, wagon roads, flumes, reservoirs, wood-camps, and mills. Much of this network centered on Spooner Summit and Incline Village. \nTahoe's east and south shores were the most heavily logged. The east shore was close to mills and transportation and the south shore was mostly flat, which made the trees easier to cut and haul. \nThe Carson Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company dominated the Comstock market. Within 25 years this single company harvested 750 million board feet of lumber and 500,000 cords of wood-enough to build 50,000 average homes. \nBy 1900 large-scale cutting ended. But the effects of logging had not. It is estimated that during the Comstock era soil erosion into Lake Tahoe increased ten-fold. \nRestoring the Future\nThe forest has re-grown and now blankets Tahoe's mountains, but it is not the same forest. Where once grew stately Jeffery and sugar pines, today the forest is dominated by white fir. \nLand managers throughout the Tahoe Basin are working to restore the forest. Controlled burns and tree plantings help improve forest health and increase plant diversity. \nAs you enjoy your hike along the Tahoe Rim Trail-recall the past. As you admire the beauty of Lake Tahoe-consider our future.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 737319, "filename": "737319.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 16, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Tahoe Rim Trail Marker", "subcaption": "Click on the image to view additional interpretive information.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1023, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.9990234375}, {"photo_id": 737321, "filename": "737321.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 16, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Tahoe Rim Trail Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 737322, "filename": "737322.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 16, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Tahoe Rim Trail Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 683, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6669921875}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.897, 39.1046]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 228504, "number": "7", "title": "St. Mary Louise Hospital", "subtitle": "55 North R Street, Virginia City, NV", "subsubtitle": "Comstock Historical Marker No. 7", "erected_year": 2009, "erected_by": "Marshall Earth Resources, Hugh Roy Marshall, Virginia City, Nevada", "address": null, "city": "Virginia City", "subcity": null, "county": "Storey County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on E Street.

Mrs. Mackay then donated the land to Father (later Bishop) Patrick Manogue of the Catholic Church for the building of the hospital. Construction took place in 1875 at a cost of about $45,000. The four story 14,000 sq. ft. brick building contained 36 rooms with five wards and 12 private rooms. Up to 70 patients could be accommodated. It was partially funded by miners and milling men, who paid $1.00 per month to support it.\nThe hospital opened and received its first patients on March 6, 1876. The daily operations of the facility were presided over by Catholic Nuns known as: “Daughters of Charity.” The hospital was in operation for 21 years, but with Virginia City’s dwindling population, it closed in September 1897, when the last two “Daughter of Charity” left the Comstock. It later served as Storey County’s Hospital until the 1940’s when a fire on the top floor forced it to close. In 1964, after much renovation the old Hospital once again opened its doors, but to a different clientele, when it became St. Mary’s Art Center.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 183170, "filename": "183170.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "St. Mary Louise Hospital Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 183172, "filename": "183172.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "October 25, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "St. Mary Louise Hospital Marker", "subcaption": "The former St. Mary Louise Hospital is in the distance.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 183171, "filename": "183171.jpeg", "photographer": null, "taken": null, "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "Detail from the St. Mary Louise Hospital Marker", "subcaption": "St. Marys Hospital & Storey County Hospital", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 681, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.6650390625}, {"photo_id": 183173, "filename": "183173.jpeg", "photographer": "Barry Swackhamer", "taken": "July 22, 2011", "submitted": "December 2, 2011, by Barry Swackhamer of Brentwood, California.", "caption": "St. Mary Louise Hospital, today the St, Mary's Art Center", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "aspect": 1.50367107195301}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.64792, 39.31072]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 229047, "number": null, "title": "Tomb of the Sierras", "subtitle": "a forest of underground timbers", "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "US Forest Service", "address": null, "city": "Carson City", "subcity": "Spooner Summit", "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Lincoln Highway (U.S. 50 at milepost 13) west of Kings Canyon Road, on the right when traveling east.

Eyes soon turned to the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains east of Lake Tahoe for more wood.\nBust!\nIn the 1890s, the boom of the Comstock was over, and with it went the demand for lumber. The Carson & Tahoe Lumber & Fluming Company’s last wood order was filled in September 1898. By then, almost every tree in the Tahoe Basin had been harvested.\nBy the early 1900s, all that remained of the once-flourishing settlement at Spooner Summit were a few sagging buildings and some dilapidated corrals. The Carson & Tahoe Lumber & Fluming Company (CTLFC) sold off land in large parcels to private interests and donated the rest to the state, liquidating its holdings. The CTLFC was dissolved in 1947.\nIn all, the Comstock produced nearly $400 million in silver and gold over its 20-year lifespan. Its rich lodes created several fortunes, helped finance the rebuilding of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake, and persuaded the U.S. government to welcome Nevada as a state even though it hadn’t yet met the population requirements (compensating instead with excess wealth).\n”The Comstock Lode may truthfully be said to be the tomb of the forests of the Sierras. Millions on millions of feet of lumber are annually buried in the mines, nevermore to be resurrected.”\n-\tWilliam Wright, 1976\n\nPanel Two:\nHungry for Wood\nthe fuel for it all\nIn addition to serving as mine-bracing lumber, wood was also needed to power steam engines for mines, mills, and railroads; build houses and storefronts; and fuel thousands of woodstoves in the harsh winters. \nOnce the wood arrived in Carson City by flume, it was stacked, dried, and loaded on Virginia & Truckee Railroad flatcars for the 21-mile route to Virginia City.\nMore than 750 million board-feet of lumber and 500,000 cords of firewood passed through Spooner Summit to meet this great demand. Yet this huge harvest represented only a fraction of the total timber felled for the Comstock – enough to have circled the Earth in a 30-foot-wide, 4-inch-thick boardwalk!\n\n\n\nPanel Three:\nConserving Out Resources\nplanning for the future\nIn 1899, President William McKinley created the Lake Tahoe Forest Reserve to conserve the remaining forests of the basin following the decades of logging for the Comstock mining boom. Following entry into the National Forest System when the US Forest Service was created in 1905, the land around Spooner Summit became part of the Carson Ranger District in 1925.\nManaging for Multiple Uses\nTasked with protecting the forestlands from overgrazing, timber harvest and unauthorized mining ventures, forest managers have stewarded the land back to health. Spooner Summit is now dramatically healthier than it was on hundred years ago.\nA Recreational Gem\nSince the 1950s, when a four-lane highway was constructed to connect Carson City to Lake Tahoe, the area surrounding Spooner Summit has become a pristine playground in winter and summer.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 738864, "filename": "738864.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": null, "submitted": "July 22, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Tomb of the Sierras Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 364, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.35546875}, {"photo_id": 738867, "filename": "738867.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 22, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Hungry for Wood Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 374, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.365234375}, {"photo_id": 738868, "filename": "738868.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 22, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Conserving Our Resources Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 338, "height": 1024, "aspect": 0.330078125}, {"photo_id": 738869, "filename": "738869.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 22, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Tomb of the Sierras Markers", "subcaption": "Marker on the right.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 739025, "filename": "739025.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 17, 2023", "submitted": "July 5, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Spooner Trailhead and Picnic Area", "subcaption": "The marker is in the background behind the left telephone pole.", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.89518, 39.10357]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 229108, "number": null, "title": "Welcome to Mormon Station State Historic Park", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Parks", "address": "2295 Main Street", "city": "Genoa", "subcity": null, "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker is on Main Street north of Genoa Lane (Nevada Route 206), on the right when traveling north.

Green boxes with red wheels became popular as well in the 1850s, and some wagon parties even painted all their wagons in custom matching colors.\nMormon Station State Historic Park", "photos": [{"photo_id": 739608, "filename": "739608.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 26, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Prairie Schooner Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 722, "aspect": 1.41828254847645}, {"photo_id": 739609, "filename": "739609.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 26, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "The Prairie Schooner and Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}, {"photo_id": 739610, "filename": "739610.jpeg", "photographer": "Joseph Alvarado", "taken": "May 14, 2023", "submitted": "July 23, 2023, by Joseph Alvarado of Livermore, California.", "caption": "Mormon Station Historic State Monument", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "aspect": 1.49926793557833}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.84542, 39.00372]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 229306, "number": null, "title": "The Journey Through Nevada", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": null, "erected_by": "Nevada State Parks", "address": "2295 Main Street", "city": "Genoa", "subcity": "Mormon Station State Historic Park", "county": "Douglas County", "state": "Nevada", "location_notes": "Marker can be reached from Main Street north of Genoa Lane (Nevada Route 206), on the right when traveling north.

After developing a proposal (The Tahoe Rim trail – a Hiking Adventure) and marketing materials with his students, the dream became a reality.

Today, the Tahoe Rim Trail Association, in cooperation with Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park and the US Forest Service Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, maintain the trail, oversee its use, and work to assure that it will be protected. The Tahoe Rim Trail recently received national status as a “National Recreation Trail.”\nAlthough the initial work is complete, the trail needs constant maintenance and occasional re-routing. Contact the Tahoe Rim Trail Association if you would like to volunteer and maintain the dream.\nThe Tahoe Rim Trail offers something for everyone, from jogging to horseback riding.

A fire in 1899 that started in the cellar did considerable structural damage and extensive repairs were needed but all 18 guests were able to escape unharmed. In 1903 the Browns sold the hotel to another pair of brothers, Charles and Henry Morrison. By 1909 it was known to offer \"excellent hotel service at moderate rates and a bar stocked with the best liquor and cigars.\" Beginning in 1914 it would be leased to a series of Basque immigrants which ultimately led to Raymond and Gorgonia Borda purchasing the building in 1921. Unfortunately, prohibition had started the year before and the East Fork Hotel would be the scene of several raids by federal law enforcement. Mr. Borda was arrested 3 times in 1922-23 for violating prohibition and the barroom was actually closed down for 8 months under the abatement law. Future lessees would also find trouble for prohibition violations. In July 1926, John \"Super Six\" Larralde was leasing the property when he was arrested in a federal raid. He was sentenced to 12 months in the Washoe County jail. This would turn out to be the last raid on the establishment. Mr. and Mrs. Borda lived there until their deaths and the building would come to be alternatively known as the Borda Building. It was finally closed down after a fire on July 17, 1986 and it stood empty until it was torn down in 2014 due to safety concerns.", "photos": [{"photo_id": 762058, "filename": "762058.jpeg", "photographer": "Troy ECV Morgan", "taken": "November 25, 2023", "submitted": "November 25, 2023, by Troy ECV Morgan of Carson City, Nevada.", "caption": "The East Fork Hotel Marker", "subcaption": null, "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 768, "aspect": 1.33333333333333}, {"photo_id": 762063, "filename": "762063.jpeg", "photographer": "Troy ECV Morgan", "taken": "November 25, 2023", "submitted": "November 25, 2023, by Troy ECV Morgan of Carson City, Nevada.", "caption": "The East Fork Hotel Marker area", "subcaption": "Actual dedication delayed to 11/25/2023 by Snowshoe Thompson Chapter #1827 of the Ancient and Honorable Order of E Clampus Vitus", "cr": "\nCopyright © _x000D_\n2005–2024, Some rights reserved.", "width": 1024, "height": 578, "aspect": 1.77162629757786}]}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-119.74861, 38.94203]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"marker_id": 237081, "number": null, "title": "Jacob Davis's Tailor Shop", "subtitle": null, "subsubtitle": null, "erected_year": 2006, "erected_by": "Historical Resources Commission", "address": "211 N.
